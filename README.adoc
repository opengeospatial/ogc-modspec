== Structure

`sources/`::
source of documents, images, and models

`_site/`::
(automatically generated, in the `gh-pages` branch) published document.

This repository uses `metanorma` to run these processes.


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/


== Building the document

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -v ${HOME}/.fontlist/fonts/:/config/fonts metanorma/metanorma metanorma compile --agree-to-terms -t ogc -x xml,html,pdf document.adoc
----
