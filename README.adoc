* https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-modspec/[OGC ModSpec (HTML)]

== General

This repository contains the ModSpec standards, including:

* The original 08-131r3 as approved in 2013
* A Reed edit branch containing the <many> proposed changes for a Version 2 revision
* Issues for discussion and resolution related to the proposed changes

== Structure

`sources/`::
source of documents and models

`_site/`::
(automatically generated, in the `gh-pages` branch) published document.


== Usage

This repository uses `metanorma` to run these processes.


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/


== Building the document

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -w /metanorma -it metanorma/mn metanorma site generate
----


== UML model definitions

This repository uses the LutaML-UML syntax in specifying the ModSpec model.

The models are located here:

* `sources/models/ogc-modspec.lutaml`

Documentation of the language is found here:

* https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml/blob/main/LUTAML.adoc
