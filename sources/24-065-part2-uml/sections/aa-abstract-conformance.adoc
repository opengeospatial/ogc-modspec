== Conformance test class: UML model extends The Standard

=== Dependency on Core

An implementation passing the UML conformance test class shall first pass the core
conformance test class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-01>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== The UML model is normative

To be conformant to this UML conformance class, UML shall be used to express the
object model, either as the core mechanism of the standard or as a normative adjunct
to formally explain the standard in a model.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-02>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Dependency graph must be explicit

A UML model shall have an explicit dependency graph for the leaf packages and
external packages used by the standard consistent with the way their classifiers use
those of other packages.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-03>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Leaf packages in only one requirements class

A UML leaf package shall be associated directly to only one requirements class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-04>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Requirements class associated to a unique package

Each requirements class shall be associated to a unique package in the model and
include either directly or by a dependency any requirement associated to any of its
subpackages.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-05>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== A requirements class contains complete leaf packages

A requirements class shall be associated to some number of complete leaf packages
and all classes and constraints in those packages.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-06>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Classes common to all requirement classes are in the core

Classes that are common to all requirements classes shall be in a package associated
to the core conformance/requirements class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-07>>.
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Package dependencies become requirements class extensions

In the UML model, if a "source" package is dependent on a "target" package then
their requirements class shall be equal or the source package's class shall be an
extension of the target package's class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-08>>.
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Dependencies in packages are reflected in dependencies in requirements classes

If one leaf package is dependent on another leaf package, then the requirements
class of the first shall be the same or an extension of the requirements class of
the second.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-09>>.
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== Co-dependent packages are in the same requirements class

If two packages have a two-way dependency (a "co-dependency"), they shall be
associated to the same requirements class.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-10>>
. Test Type: Conformance.

=== All classes are in leaf packages

The UML model shall segregate all classes into leaf packages.

. Test Purpose: Verify that this requirement is satisfied.
. Test Method: Inspect the document to verify the above.
. Reference: <<req-11>>
. Test Type: Conformance.
