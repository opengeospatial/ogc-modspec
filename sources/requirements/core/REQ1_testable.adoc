[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/core/reqs-are-testable
part:: All the parts of a requirement _SHALL_ be testable. 
part:: Failure to pass any part of a requirement _SHALL_ be a failure to pass the associated conformance test.
====

NOTE: This further means that failure to pass the test specified for a part of requirement is a failure to pass the requirement.
Therefore, by definition, any requirements class that contains the requirement that failed to pass also fails to pass.
