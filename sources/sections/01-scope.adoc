== Scope

The ModSpec defines characteristics and structure for the specification of Standards 
that will encourage implementation by minimizing difficulty determining
requirements, mimicking implementation structure and maximizing usability and
interoperability.

NOTE: For OGC Standards work, the word “standard” in this document applies to all OGC draft standards, approved standards, draft Abstract Specifications, and approved Abstract Specifications. The exceptions are OGC Abstract Specifications that originate in ISO or Community Standards that are developed external to the OGC and then submitted to the OGC.

<<Annex-B>> defines the UML model upon which the ModSpec is
based. Annex B also contains informal and non-normative definitions ordered for ease
of understanding. These two sections can be read first to aid in the understanding of
the rest of the document.
