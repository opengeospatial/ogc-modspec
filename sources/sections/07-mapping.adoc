== Mapping this standard to types of models

=== Semantics

The previous section defined requirements for conformance to the ModSpec, but
testing for that conformance may depend on how the various forms and parts of a
candidate conformant standard are viewed. This clause specifiess how those views
are to be defined in most of the common cases. Standards that take an alternative
mechanism to the ones listed here must be tested solely on the structure of their
conformance test suite, until an extension to ModSpec is defined for that
alternate mechanism.

Standards are often structured about some form of modeling language, or
implementation paradigm. This clause looks at some common types of models and
defines a mechanism to map parts of the model (language, schema, etc.) to the
conformance classes used as the model from <<cls-6-1>>.

As suggested in Clause <<req-22>>, the structure of the normative clauses in a
standard should parallel the structure of the conformance requirements classes in
that standard. The structure of the normative clauses in a well written
standard will follow the structure of its model. This means that all three are
parallel.

=== Data Models

==== Common modeling issues

#If a data model is to be used to define the parameters of operational interfaces,
then that model should belong in the core since it can be considered as part of a
common reference model and vocabulary.#

If a data model is to be used to create "data transfer" elements, the issue is more
complex. In the use of parameter names and types in the operational model above, the
definition of a common vocabulary in the core is justifiable. In the case where data
transfer elements are being defined, it may be that some types and elements are a
defining separator between conformance classes and have to exist independently of
such data elements defined for non-dependent classes. *#For these reasons, care
should be taken in creating separable data transfer schemas across requirements.#*
Dependencies in the schemas will have to parallel the dependencies in the
requirements classes. The mechanism for enforcing this is dependent on the schema
language.

==== Optional Requirements class: UML model extension to the core

If the organizing mechanism for the data model used in the standrd is an object model, then the
mapping from parts of the model to the requirements classes should follow the
logical mechanism described here.

The terminology used here is common to all versions of the UML standard, and may
be applied to any such version.

First, by the requirements above, the extension relationship of this conformance
test class to the core will be made explicit.

Assuming all legitimate direct package dependencies are included in the UML model,
the conformance/requirements class associated to a package stem:[A] will directly
reference the conformance/requirements class associated to another package stem:[B],
if and only if stem:[A] is dependent on stem:[B]. Indirect dependencies will be
dealt with as the conformance classes cascade.

This clause uses UML terminology, but other object modeling languages and, if
needed, the object code itself can be mapped to a UML model.

|*REQ030* | * /req/core/uml/dependency-graph* +
A UML model _SHALL_ have an explicit dependency graph for the leaf packages and

those of other packages
|===

NOTE: External packages having predated the current version of the standard will
not normally have dependencies to packages within the standard.

Other dependencies (indirect) will arise from the transitive closure of the above
direct dependencies. That means if stem:[A] depends on stem:[B], and stem:[B]
depends on stem:[C] then stem:[A] depends on stem:[C]. Since these indirect
dependencies will show up in the cascade of included conformance tests based solely
on the direct dependencies, we can ignore them for effects on structure.

Since a package can consist solely of other packages, there is always the capability
to define in UML a single package that will correspond to a particular requirements
class and its associated conformance class.

[[req-31]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A UML leaf package shall be associated directly to only one requirements class.#
====

[[req-32]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each requirements class shall be associated to a unique package in the model and
include either directly or by a dependency any requirement associated to any of its
subpackages.#
====

The class definitions are the "requirements" of a UML expressed standard. Therefore the
logical consequence of the above is to organize requirements classes based on leaf
packages.

[[req-33]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A requirements class shall be associated to some number of complete leaf packages
and all classes and constraints in those packages.#
====

If a requirement uses or refers to elements of more than one package, then one of
the packages will be called the source of the requirement, and the other targets.
The requirement with the same source package will always be associated to same
requirements module and/or class.

[[req-34]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Classes that are common to all requirements classes shall be in a package
associated to the core conformance/requirements class.#
====

This is actually a derived requirement and is repeated here for emphasis.

This dependency of requirements classes will be consistent with the usual mechanism
for describing the source and target of dependencies between packages. By Clause
<<req-22>>, only classes in the source requirements class will be affected by the
requirement.

In UML, source and target dependency relations are defined in such a way that the
source of the relation is dependent on the target of the relation.

[[req-35]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#In the UML model, if a "source" package is dependent on a "target" package then
their requirements class shall be equal or the source package's class shall be an
extension of the target package's class.#
====

This means that the dependency graph of the UML packages parallels in some sense the
extension diagram of the requirements/conformance classes. If all leaf
packages of the model are moved into "requirements class packages" containing their
corresponding modeling packages the model then satisfies the following
recommendation: *#Each requirements class in a conformant standard should be
associated to one and only one UML package (which may contain sub-packages for a
finer level of structure). If the core requirements class contains only
recommendations, it may be an exception to this.#*

[[req-36]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If one leaf package is dependent on another leaf package, then the requirements
class of the first shall be the same or an extension of the requirements class of
the second.#
====

[[req-37]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If two packages have a two-way dependency (a "co-dependency"), they shall be
associated to the same requirements class.#
====

For example, if two classes have a two-way navigable association, then these two
classes must be (transitively) in the same conformance requirements class package.

The hierarchical structure of a UML model is based on UML classes, residing in UML
packages. UML packages can then reside in larger UML packages. Although there is
nothing to demand it, it is a common practice to move all classes down the hierarchy
to leaf packages. Leaf packages are those that contain only classes (that is,
contain no smaller subpackages). Classes can act as packages in the sense that a UML
class can contain a locally defined class whose scope is the class itself. For our
purposes, we will consider a class and its contained local classes to all be in the
package of the original class.

#The UML model shall segregate all classes into leaf packages.#

[[cls-7-2-3]]
==== Requirements class: The XML schema extension to the core

This requirements class covers any standard which has as one of its purposes
the introduction of a new XML schema. Such a standard would normally define the
schema, all of its components, and its intended uses.

First, by the requirements above, the extension relationship of this conformance
test class to the core must be made explicit.

[[req-39]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#An implementation passing the XML schema conformance test class shall first pass
the ModSpec core conformance test class.#
====

[[req-40]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#An implementation passing the XML schema conformance test class shall first pass
the W3C Recommendation for XML schema.#
====

Each XML schema file (usually *.xsd) carries a target namespace specification, recorded in the
`targetNamespace` attribute of the `<schema>` element in the XML representation. In
its implementation, this namespace is represented by a globally unique identifier, a
URI. All schema components defined with that URI as its namespace designation are
part of the same module in XML schema.

The XML Schema specification lists those resolution strategies for namespace and
schema that a schema-aware process may use. They work in a predictable fashion
independent of the choice of strategy if and only if the schemas are in a one to one
correspondence to their namespace. A schema may be dependent on another schema and
may contain "import" directives that load all such schemas whenever it is loaded.

When a process loads a schema as defined by its namespace URI
identity, it must always get a linkage to all components in that namespace. If not,
then at sometime in the future, the process will fail when it finds a reference to
such a component that it missed. To prevent this sort of failure, when a
schema-aware process first encounters a namespace URI it must always be associated
to a schema location (a file) that contains or includes all schema components having
the URI as their namespace. This is referred to as the "all-components schema
document".

In defining a XML schema (either completely, or partially in a standard) the
fundamental component or module of XML schema is always the namespace and its
associated schema; which is designated by a URI.

[[req-41]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If a standard conformant to the XML schema conformance class defines a set of
data schemas, all components (e.g. elements, attributes, types ...) associated with
a single conformance test class shall be scoped to a single XML namespace.#
====

[[req-42]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The all-components schema document for an XML Schema shall indicate the URI of the
associated conformance test class in the schema/annotation/appinfo element.#
====

The mechanism for dependencies may either be by importation or by inclusion of
schema components.

[example]
====
In GML 3, the spatial schema (ISO 19107) and the general feature model (ISO 19109)
are both satisfied by elements within the single GML namespace. A viable alternative
would to have put the schema components for spatial schema and feature schema in
separate namespaces.
====

This is a choice of design, and at the level of the ModSpec, the trade-off factors
cannot be prejudged because the details of such cost-benefit trade-offs are not
constant. Either of the above approaches may be used.

[[req-43]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If a standard conformant to the XML schema conformance class defines a direct
dependency from one requirement class to another, then a standardization target of
the corresponding conformance test class shall import a schema that has passed the
associated conformance test class (dependency) or shall itself pass the associated
conformance test class.#
====

NOTE: This implies that the value of the schemaLocation on the `<import>` element
will refer to the all-components schema document.

*#An all-components schema document may be assembled by inclusion of documents that
describe subsets of the components associated with the conformance test class.#*
This allows schema designers to do some modularization within a namespace for
convenience, notwithstanding the requirement for an all-components schema document.

NOTE: A namespace variable is used if the requirements class is not defining a
schema, but defining requirements for a schema to be the target of its conformance
class. For example, GML defines requirements for application schemas, but does not a
priori know the namespace of any application schema. The namespace for the
application schema becomes a variable in the conformance test cases.

[[req-44]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#No requirements class in a specification conformant to the XML schema conformance
class shall modify elements, types or any other requirement from a namespace to
which it is not associated.#
====

*#Requirements may add constraints.#* This allows extensions to restrict:

. Usage of existing elements, but only if their use was originally optional. This is
similar to the rules for inheritance (such as in UML or other object models), where
a class can eliminate an attribute from a superclass only if the superclass
attribute includes a "0" in its multiplicity range.
. The type of existing elements, to sub-types of the original elements. This is
similar to the rules for inheritance, where a class can re-define an attribute or
association role from a superclass so that its type or class is a specialization of
the original.

In summary, effective modularization is enabled by following the pattern of one
conformance class per XML namespace; i.e. the set of components in an XML namespace
should be referred to as a whole. Subsetting of components in a single XML namespace
for conformance purposes is not permitted.

[[cls-7-2-4]]
==== Requirements class: Schematron extension to the ModSpec Core

Schematron (<<iso19757-3>>) provides a notation with which many constraints on XML
documents can be expressed. This requirements class covers any standard that
uses Schematron to create patterns or constrains for an XML Schema. First the schema
must be defined within the bounds of the XML schema requirements class.

[[req-45]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard passing the Schematron conformance test class shall also define or
reference an XML schema that shall pass the XML schema conformance class from this
standard.#
====

Within a Schematron schema, the "pattern" and "schema" elements may be used in a way
that corresponds with conformance tests and a conformance test class as follows:

[[req-46]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each sch:pattern element shall implement constraints described in no more than one
requirement. Each requirement shall be implemented by no more than one sch:pattern.#
====

[[req-47]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each sch:pattern element shall be contained within one sch:schema element.#
====

[[req-48]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]

#The value of the sch:schema/@fpi attribute shall be a URI that identifies this
implementation#
====

[[req-49]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The value of the sch:schema/@see attribute shall be the identifier for the
requirements class that contains the requirement(s) implemented by the schema#
====

[[req-50]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The value of the sch:schema/@fpi attribute shall be used on only one Schematron
schema.#
====

[[cls-7-2-5]]
==== Requirements class: XML meta-schema extension tothe ModSpec Core

This requirements class covers any standard which has as one of its purposes
the introduction of a new type of XML schema. Such a standard would normally
define the characteristics of such schema, how its components are created and its
intended uses.

First, by the requirements above, the extension relationship of this conformance
test class to the core must be made explicit.

[[req-51]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard passing the XML meta-schema conformance test class shall first pass
the core specification conformance test class.#
====

Since the target specification will be defining requirements for XML schemas, it
will require that the ModSpec be used.

[[req-52]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard passing the XML meta-schema conformance test class shall require
that its specification targets (XML schema) pass the XML schema conformance class
from the ModSpec.#
