== Mapping the ModSpec to types of models

=== Semantics

The previous section defines requirements for conformance to the ModSpec core requirements. However,
testing for that conformance may depend on how the various forms and parts of a
conformant standard are viewed. Additional Parts to the ModSpec Standard specify how those views
are to be defined. Standards that take an alternative
mechanism to the ones defined in the additional Parts must be tested solely on the structure of their
conformance test suite until such times as an extension to the ModSpec is defined for that
alternate mechanism.

Standards are often structured and documented using some form of modeling language, or
implementation paradigm. Additional Parts to the ModSpec
define a mechanism to map parts of the model (language, schema, etc.) to the conformance classes 
used in the ModSpec model as defined in the core ModSpec Requirements Class.

As suggested in Clause <<req-22>>, the structure of the normative clauses in a
standard should parallel the structure of the conformance test classes in
that standard. The structure of the normative clauses in a well written
standard will follow the structure of its model. This means that all three are
parallel.

=== A Note on Data Models

If a data model is to be used to define the parameters of operational interfaces,
then that model should belong in the core since it can be considered as part of a
common reference model and vocabulary.

If a data model is to be used to create "data transfer" elements, the issue is more
complex. In the use of parameter names and types in the operational model above, the
definition of a common vocabulary in the core is justifiable. In the case where data
transfer elements are being defined, it may be that some types and elements are a
defining separator between conformance classes and have to exist independently of
such data elements defined for non-dependent classes. For these reasons, care
should be taken in creating separable data transfer schemas across requirements.
Dependencies in the schemas will have to parallel the dependencies in the
requirements classes. The mechanism for enforcing this is dependent on the schema
language.
