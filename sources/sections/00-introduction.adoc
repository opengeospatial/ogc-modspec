== Introduction

This OGC document, also known as the `ModSpec` specifies rules for the internal structure and organization of a standard. The ModSpec is designed to enable the clear and concise specification of requirements (the _shalls_ or _musts_ in a standard) that fully supports the ability to define implementable conformance tests. An objective of this approach is to enable implementations of a standard to be tested and deemed _conformant_ . . . or not.

NOTE: Please note that the ModSpec has been approved by the OGC Membership as a policy directive for the development and revision of any OGC Standard or Abstract Specification that has requirements. However, the ModSpec is written to be non-OGC specific and can be used by any Standards Development Organization (SDO) as a formal guide for structuring a standards document.

A standard presents requirements, which must be satisfied by passing the tests defined in a conformance suite (also known as the Abstract Test Suite in an OGC Standard). These tests are organized into conformance classes, each of which represents a mechanism for partial satisfaction of the standard. This results in a standard having a modular structure, where each requirements class has a corresponding conformance (test) class. In a well written standard, the normative clauses and any model or schema are organized in a manner that parallels the requirements and conformance clauses. A goal of the design pattern is the ability to define requirements classes and associated conformance classes that can be used across multiple standards. 

There are numerous examples of requirements/conformance classes that can be used not only in OGC Standards, but for geospatially focused standards defined by other organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). Some OGC examples can be found in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common Part 1: Core Standard] and in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/cdbswg/blob/master/cdb-2.0/cdb-core-crs-requirements-class.adoc[CDB 2.0 Standard CRS Requirements Module]. By formally implementing the requirements specified in the ModSpec, reusable, modular standrds can be developed. 

=== ModSpec document structure

Version 2.0 of the ModSpec is split into a Core standard and multiple Parts. These are:

- Core: contains all the core requirements and informational text that define the model and internal structure of a standard.
- Part 1: UML Model requirements 
- Part 2: XML Model requirements 
- Part 3: Schematron requirements 
- Part 4: XML Metaschema requirements

Future Parts to the ModSpec Standard may include:

- Part 5: RDF/OWL requirements

=== Building Blocks

In software development technology, there is a concept called _building block_. In software development, building blocks are used to support the software build process where source code files/libraries can be accessed from multiple sources, converted into executable code, and linked together in the proper order until a complete set of executable files is generated. The same concept can be applied to OGC Standards development: Requirements classes and/or modules can be linked together from one or more standards to create a new standard not originaly envisioned when the requirements were originally defined.

The https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap32.html[Open Group] suggests that building blocks have the following characteristics:

. A building block is a package of functionality defined to meet business or domain needs.
. A building block may interoperate with other, inter-dependent, building blocks.
. A good building block has the following characteristics:
.. It considers implementation and usage, and evolves to exploit technology and standards.
.. It may be assembled from other building blocks.
.. It may be a subassembly of other building blocks.
.. Ideally a building block is re-usable and replaceable, and well specified.
. A building block may have multiple implementations but with different inter-dependent building blocks.

These characteristics are slightly modified from the Open Group definitions to accommodate the use of the buidling block concept in standards work.

NOTE: The approach modelled in the ModSpec has been referred to as the "core and extension model" due to its
insistence on a modular structure throughout all parts of a standard and its implementation.
