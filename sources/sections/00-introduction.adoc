== Introduction

NOTE: Reading the Terms and Definitions clause and Clause <TBD> will help understanding the content and
requirements stated in this document.

This OGC document, also known as the `ModSpec`:

- Specifies rules for the internal structure and organization of a standard. 
- Defines requirements for specifying the structure of a standards document as organized sets of criteria, those that are to be tested ("requirements") and those that are not tested ("recommendations" and "permissions"). 
- Designed to enable the clear and concise specification of requirements (the _shalls_ or _musts_ in a standard) that fully supports the ability to define implementable conformance tests. 

The goal of this approach is to enable implementations of a standard to be tested and deemed _conformant_ or not.

NOTE: Please note that the ModSpec has been approved by the OGC Membership as a policy directive for the development and revision of any OGC Standard or Abstract Specification that has requirements. However, the ModSpec is written to be non-OGC specific and can be used by any Standards Development Organization (SDO) as a formal guide for structuring a standards document.

A standard that follows the rules specified in the ModSpec presents requirements organized in requirements classes which must be satisfied by passing the tests defined in a conformance suite (also known as the Abstract Test Suite in an OGC Standard). These tests are organized into conformance classes, each of which represents a mechanism for partial satisfaction of the standard. This results in a standard having a modular structure, where each requirements class has a corresponding conformance (test) class. In a well written standard, the normative clauses and any model or schema are organized in a manner that parallels the requirements and conformance clauses. A goal of the design pattern is the ability to define requirements classes and associated conformance classes that can be used across multiple standards. 

There are numerous examples of requirements/conformance classes that can be used not only in OGC Standards, but for geospatially focused standards defined by other organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). Some OGC examples can be found in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common Part 1: Core Standard] and in the https://github.com/opengeospatial/cdbswg/blob/master/cdb-2.0/cdb-core-crs-requirements-class.adoc[CDB 2.0 Standard CRS Requirements Module]. By formally implementing the requirements specified in the ModSpec, reusable, modular standards can be developed.

NOTE: The approach modelled in the ModSpec has been referred to as the "core and extension model" due to its
insistence on a modular structure throughout all parts of a standard and its implementation.

=== ModSpec document structure

Version 2.0 of the ModSpec will be split into a Core standard and multiple Parts. This document includes the following parts:

- Core: contains all the core requirements and informational text that define the model and internal structure of a standard.
- Part 1: UML Model requirements 

Future Parts to the ModSpec Standard will include:

- Part 2: Specifying requirements and conformance tests using JSON.
- Part 3: Specifying requirements and conformance tests using RDFS, SHACL, and OWL
- Part 4: Specifying requirements and conformance tests using XML and Schematron.
