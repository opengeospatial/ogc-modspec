==== Imported Conformance class tests are consistent with the specification

If a requirements class is imported from another standard for use within a standard conformant to the ModSpec, and if any imported requirement is “optional,” then that requirement _SHALL_ be factored out as a separate requirements class in the profile of that imported standard used in the conformant standard.

==== Every extension has a consistent target type

Every requirements class in a standard, with the exception of the core, _SHALL_ have a standardization target type which is a subtype of that of the core.
