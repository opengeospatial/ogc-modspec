== Requirements Class: Core

[[cls-6-1]]
=== The model

The ModSpec defines requirements for specifying the structure as organized sets of
criteria, those that are to be tested ("requirements") and those that are not tested
("recommendations" and "permissions"). All OGC Standards, formally or informally, create an
abstraction of the things to which they apply (called an "abstract model") in order to provide a context for stating
requirements.

NOTE: For OGC Standards, the assumptions is that documents are in a commonly used
logical form (template). 

This form should be specified by the following descriptions:

. A standards document contains Clauses (corresponding to numbered sections as they might
appear in a table of contents) which describe its standardization target and its requirements.
. An OGC Standard or Abstract Specification contains Annexes or is associated to other documents (both a
logical type of Clause), one of which is the Conformance Test Suite (which may be an
abstract description of the test suites to be implemented separately). In OGC Documents, this is Annex A â€“ Abstract Test Suite.
. All requirements, recommendations, permissions, and models are introduced and defined first in
the numbered Clauses.
. All requirements are identifiable as requirements. In OGC and ISO, this means use
of "normative" language, meaning the proper use of SHALL, SHOULD, CAN and MAY or
similar wording in the passive voice. All requirements in a document are uniquely numbered.
. All tests for conformance to those requirements are defined in the Conformance Test
Suite.  Is OGC Standards documents, this is the Abstract Test Suite (ATS).
. Tests are be grouped for convenience into conformance test classes and if desired the classes are grouped into conformance test modules.
. The tests, if conducted, determine to some degree of certainty whether an
implementation meets the requirements which the tests reference.
. The tests are organized into some number of conformance "classes" where each conformance class has a one to one relationship with a requirements class. If a standard
does not do this, it is has by default only one "conformance class".
. Certificates of conformance (see <<term-all-components-schema-document>>) are
awarded by a testing entity based on these conformance classes.
. There is a clear distinction between normative and informative parts of the text.
. Examples and notes are informative, and do not use "normative"
language.{blank}footnote:[In this standard, in informative sections, the word "will"
implies that something is an implication of a requirement. The "will" statements are
not requirements, but explain the consequence of requirements.]

A UML representation of important properties of this model is given in <<annex-B-2>>.

The ModSpec defines a "requirement" of a standard as an atomic testable
criterion. See the formal definition of requirement in <<term-requirement>>

All the parts of a requirement, a requirement module, or requirements class SHALL be
testable. Failure to pass any part of any requirement shall be a failure to pass the

This further means that failure to pass the test specified for a part of requirement is a
failure to pass the requirement.

[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ002* | */req/core/uml/all-components-assigned-uri* +
Each component of the standard, including requirements, requirements modules,
requirements classes, conformance test cases, conformance modules and conformance
classes SHALL be assigned a URI. 
For OGC standards documents, these URIs SHALL be conformant with the https://www.ogc.org/about-ogc/policies/ogcna/[OGC Naming Authority policies].

|===
|*REC001* | */req/core/uml/uri-external-use* +
These URI identities should be used in any external documentation that reference
these component elements in a normative manner, including but not limited to other
standards, implementations of the conformance test suite, or certificates of
conformance for implementations conformant to the standard in question.
|===

NOTE: In the OGC, The precise the enforcement of this requirement and its associated recommendation is the purview of
the OGC Naming Authority or its equivalents.

While a requirement may be referenced in more than one place in a standard, the normative definition of a requirement shall be its "*#home#*" (see <<cls-5-3>>) and
will be the only place where full normative language is used.

In the conformance test suite there will be a test defined to verify the validity of
the claim that an implementation of the standard (standardization target) satisfies
each requirement. Since the normative language of the body of the standard and the
conformance test classes both define what conformance to the standard means, they
will be equivalent in a well-written specification.The ModSpec requires
a standards document to be well-written, at least in stating requirements and conformance
tests.

Conformance tests are aggregated into conformance classes that specify how certain
"certificates of conformance" are achieved. The natural inclination is to aggregate
the requirements. The issue that blocks this approach is that some requirements are
optional while others are mandatory. To achieve a cleaner separation of requirements,
the ModSpec separates them into sets (called "requirements classes"), each of which
has no optional components. Since the normative statement of each requirement is only 
declared once and is uniquely identified as such, each requirement will be in a clause associated to its requirements class.

Therefore, the ModSpec defines a "requirements class" as a set of requirements that must
all be passed to achieve a particular conformance class (see
<<term-conformance-test-class>>). This document also includes a "middle" structure
called a conformance test module, this document also includes requirements modules to
parallel the conformance test modules. A standard written to the ModSpec may
use this "module" structure in any manner consistent with the rest of this Policy.

A standard may have mandatory and optional requirements classes.  This allows the options
in the testing procedure to be grouped into non-varying mandatory and optional conformance classes.
Each requirement within an optional requirements class is mandatory when that requirements class is
implemented. When needed, a particular requirements class may contain only a single
requirement.

However, care must be taken, since the requirements classes may not always in a one-to-one
correspondence to conformance classes in other standards which may be the source of
requirements for a standard conformant to this Policy. If other standards are
used, their options shall be specified to be useable within a standard conformant to
this policy, see <<cls-6-5-1>>.

Conformance classes may contain dependencies on one another. These are represented by
tests in one conformance class that state that another conformance class must be
passed to qualify to pass this conformance class. In terms of requirements, that says
that the dependent conformance class contains tests (by reference) for all
requirements of the "included" conformance class.

From the ModSpec's view of requirements classes, one requirements
class is dependent on another if the other is included through such a reference. In
this manner, requirements classes can be treated as sets of requirements (each in a
single requirements class but included in others by reference to its "home"
requirements class).

In the ModSpec, each conformance requirement is separated in its own labeled
paragraph, such as <<req-1>> above.

The distribution of the information in a standard is not restricted. The only
requirement will be that requirements be grouped in a manner
consistent with the conformance test classes, see <<req-6>> and <<req-7>>.

The informational and structural universals of the standard may be included in the
core text and its associated models without violations of the ModSpec. This is
true if the requirements of the extension are not implicit in what is
included in the core.
|===

In this manner, the core requirements class and its associated contents can be
thought of not only as the requirements of the core conformance class, but as a form
of reference model for establishing core vocabularies and schemas for the entire
standard.

requested operation is part of a non-supported extension.

[example]
====
In the specification of a metadata service, the Dublin Core concept of a "Title" and
the XML schema structure used for its specification can be in the core of the service
specification. How a particular request-response pair uses the data structure to mean
the title of a particular document or dataset will be specified in the requirements
class in which the request-response pair is defined and set against requirements.
====

[[cls-6-2]]
=== Using the model

The primary difficulty in speaking about standards (or candidate
standards){blank}footnote:[This is purposely written as "as not yet adopted"
standards, since it is during the authoring process that the ModSpec must be
considered, not _post facto_.] as a group is their diverse
nature. Some standards use UML to define behavior, others use XML to define data
structures, and others use no specific modeling language at all. However, they all
must model the standardization target to which they apply since they need to use
unambiguous language to specify requirements. Thus, the only thing they have in
common is that they define testable requirements against some
model of an implementation of the standard (the standardization target). For
completeness, they should also specify the conformance tests for these requirements
that are to be run for validation of the implementations against those
requirements.

NOTE: This "test suite" specification is a requirement for
ISO and for OGC, but is often ignored in less formal standardization efforts. In such
cases, if there exists a "validation authority" for conformance, they must interpret
the requirements to be tested, _ex parte_, possibly separated from the authors of the
standard, leading to issues of separate interpretations of the same specification.

The assumption is that each standard has a single
(root) standardization target type from which all extensions inherit. If this is not
true, then the standard can be logically factored into parts each corresponding
to a "root" standardization target type, and that the standard addresses each
such part separately (see the definition of requirements class in
<<term-requirements-class>>). In this sense, the next requirement divides
standard into parts more than restricting their content.

[[req-4]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each requirement in a conformant standard SHALL have a single standardization
target type.#
====

In practice, the standardization target of the core requirements class is the root
of an inheritance tree where extensions all have the core's target as an ancestor,
and thus can be considered as belonging to the same "class" or type as the core's
target.

[[req-5]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#All conformance tests in a single conformance test class in a conformant
standard shall have the same standardization target.#
====

This means that all requirements are considered as targeting the same entity being
tested for a particular certificate of conformance. The test may specify other types
as intermediaries or indirect dependencies (see
<<term-indirect-dependency-(of-a-requirements-class)>>).

*#If needed, a requirement may be repeated word for word in another requirement up
to but not including the identification of the standardization target type.#* This
second statement will be in a separate requirements class, since it will have a
separate standardization target and thus belong to the requirements to be tested by
a separate conformance class. For example, in a service interface, a standard
may be written that requires both the client and server to use a particular language
for data transmission. Since the client and server are different standardization
targets types (except in some special circumstances), they will have different
conformance test classes.

One solution is to state the requirement twice, once for each target. The most
common alternative is to introduce a new "superclass". *#The specification may
introduce an abstract superclass of all affected standardization target types and
use this for the requirements common to all of the affected target types.#* This is
diagrammed in <<fig-6-1>>.

[[cls-6-3]]
=== The "standards" document

Each standard document is comprised of a set of requirements and their associated conformance tests.

[[req-6]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Requirements SHALL be grouped together in clauses (numbered sections) of the
document in a strictly hierarchical manner, consistent with 
requirements classes.#
====

[[req-7]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The requirements structure of the document SHALL be in a logical correspondence to
the test suite structure.#
====

This structure is described in the following clause. If two requirements are
in the same requirments class, they should be tested in the same conformance
class in the conformance suite. *#Each requirement may be separately identifiable
either by a label as is done in this document, by its subclause number, or by its
subclause number and full text.#*

The level of the clauses at which the requirements classes corresponding to the test
suite classes are organized is the purview of the editing body of the document, but
should be obvious from the language of the clause titles. For example, if UML
packages or XML schemas are used to express the factoring of the document into test
suite defined conformance classes, the document should use package or schema names
in the "table of contents" outline of the standard to indicate the correspondence to
test suite classes.

Since these clauses, conformance classes, packages and schemas represent the most
important divisions of the test suite and thus of the requirements classes, their
name should be included in the table of contents (TOC) of the standard document, and
should all be at the same level of heading.

In summary, the structure of the requirements and requirements classes of the model
should be reflected in the organization of the conformance tests and classes, and
also in the structure of the normative clauses in the specification document.

[[cls-6-4]]
=== Conformance Test Suite

The requirements specified in this clause will be applied directly to the test suite, and in particular
to the conformance classes. By definition, a "test suite" is a collection of
identifiable conformance classes. A conformance class is a well-defined set of
conformance tests. Each conformance test is a concrete or abstract (depending on the
type of suite) description of a test to be performed on each candidate conformant
implementation, to determine if it meets a well-defined set of requirements as
stated in the normative clauses of the standards document.

NOTE: The Test Suite is normative in the sense that it describes the tests to be
performed to pass conformance, but it specifies no requirements in any other sense.
The requirements should be specified in the body of the standard. The test suite
only describes in detail how those requirements should be tested.

In each of the profiles defined in the Clauses to follow, some set of entities,
types, elements or objects are defined and segregated into implementation
requirements classes.

[[req-8]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The requirements classes shall be in a one-to-one correspondence to the conformance
test classes, and thus to the various certificate of conformance types possible for
a candidate implementation.#
====

Strict parallelism of implementation and governance is the essence of this standard.

=== Requirements for Modularity

[[cls-6-5-1]]
==== Each Conformance class tests a complete requirements class

[[req-9]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class SHALL not contain any optional conformance tests.#
====

This requirement stops
conformance classes from containing optional requirements and tests, and, at least
as far as the standard is concerned, makes all certificates of conformance mean
that exactly the same tests have been conducted. Standards documents may use
recommendations for such options, but the conformance test classes do not test
recommendations.

*#A Conformance class may be parameterized.#* This means that the class's tests
depend on some parameter that must be defined before the tests can be executed. For
example, if a XYZ conformance class needs to specify a data format such as GML or
KML to be tested, then XYZ(GML) is XYZ using GML, and XYZ(KML) is XYZ using KML.
*#Because the parameters choose which requirements will be tested, two conformance
classes with distinct parameters should be considered as distinct conformance
classes.#*

The most common parameters are the identities of indirect dependencies. For example,
if a service uses or produces feature data, the format of that data may be a
parameter, such as GML, KML or GeoJSON. When reading a certificate of conformance,
the values of such parameters are very important.

[[req-10]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A certificate of conformance SHALL specify all parameter values used to pass the
tests in its conformance test class.#
====

Conformance to a particular conformance class means exactly the same thing everywhere.

[[req-11]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class SHALL explicitly test only requirements from a single
requirements class.#
====

This means that there is a strict correspondence between the requirements classes
and the conformance test classes in the test suite. Recall that a conformance test
class may specify dependencies causing other conformance test classes to be used,
but this is a result of an explicit requirement in the "home" requirements class.

[[req-12]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A Conformance class SHALL specify any other conformance class upon which it is
dependent and that other conformance class shall be used to test the specified
dependency.#
====

Such referenced conformance classes may be in the same standard or may be a
conformance class of another standard.

[[example-6-2]]
[example]
.Indirect dependency on schema
====
If a service specifies that a particular output is required to be conformant to a
conformance test class in a specific standard (say a normatively referenced XML
schema), then the conformance class of that normative reference will be used to test
that output. For example, if an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) implementation instance specifies that its feature collection output is
compliant to a particular profile of GML, then that profile of GML will be used to
validate that output. This means that the service is indirectly tested using the GML
standard. In other words, GML is an indirect dependency of the original service.
====

Requirements classes may be optional as a whole, but not piecemeal. This means that
every implementation that passed a particular conformance class satisfies exactly
the same requirements and passes exactly the same conformance tests. Differences
between implementations will be determined by which conformance test classes are
passed, not by listing of which options within a class were tested. If a
standard's authors wish to make a particular requirement optional, <<req-9>>
forces them to include it in a separate requirements class (and therefore in a
separate conformance test class) which can be left untested.

NOTE: Standards developed outside the OGC may not follow a strict parallelism between requirement specification
and testing, so for use within a specification compliant to this standard, special
care must be taken in importing conformance test classes from other standards.

[[req-13]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If a requirements class is imported from another standard for use within a
specification conformant to this standard, and if any imported requirement is
"optional," then that requirement SHALL be factored out as a separate requirements
class in the profile of that imported standard used in the conformant specification.
Each such used requirements class SHALL be a conformance class of the source
standard or a combination of conformance classes of the source standard or standards.#
====

The tracking of the parallelism between requirements and tests should be easy if the
standards document is non-ambiguous. To insure this, by utilizing the names of the two types of classes the following requirement places a
default mapping between the two.

[[req-14]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#For the sake of consistency and readability, all requirements classes and all
conformance test classes SHALL be explicitly named, with corresponding requirements
classes and conformance test classes having similar names.#
====

[NOTE]
====
Logically, a requirements class (set of requirements) and a conformance class (set
of tests) are not comparable. This can be remedied by noting that both have a
consistent relation to a set of requirements. A requirements class is a set of
requirements. A conformance class tests a set of requirements. Therefore a requirements class corresponds precisely to a conformance class if they
both are related (as described) to the same set of requirements.


====

[[cls-6-5-2]]
==== Requirements classes contain all requirements tested by a conformance test case

[[req-15]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each requirement in the standard SHALL be contained in one and only one
requirements class. Inclusion of any requirement in a requirements class by a
conformance class shall imply inclusion of all requirements in its class (as a
dependency).#
====

Unless a requirement is referenced in a conformance test and thus in a conformance
class, it cannot be considered a requirement since no test has been defined for it.
*#If possible, the structure of the normative clauses of the standard should
parallel the structure of the conformance classes in the conformance clause.#*

[NOTE]
====
This in conjunction with <<req-9>> means that all requirements in a conformant
standard will be tested in some conformance class. In the best example, a
requirement should be contained explicitly in one and only one requirements class
and tested in one and only one conformance class. This is not really a requirement
here, since a single requirement can be stated twice in different requirements
classes.
====

[[req-16]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#If any two requirements are co-dependent (each
dependent on the other) then they shall be in the same requirements class. If any
two requirements classes are co-dependent, they shall be merged into a single class.#
====

Normally, circular dependencies between implementation components are signs of a
poor design, but they often cannot be avoided because of other considerations (code
ownership for example). *#Circular dependencies of all types should be avoided
whenever possible.#*

[[req-17]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#There SHALL be a natural structure on the requirements classes so that each may be
implemented on top of any implementations of its dependencies and independent of its
extensions.#
====

[NOTE]
====
The only certain manner to test this requirement maybe to create a reference
implementation.

This requirement is more important and may be more difficult than it seems. It
states simply that conformance classes and their associated requirements classes can
be put in a one-to-one correspondence to a fully modular implementation of the
complete standard (at least all of the specification against a single
standardization target). Implementors who wish to sacrifice modularity for some
other benefit can still do what they want; the requirement here only states that if
the software requirements classes are properly separated, they can be implemented in
a "plug'n'play" fashion.
====

[[req-18]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#No requirements class SHALL redefine the requirements of its dependencies, unless
that redefinition is for an entity derived from but not contained in those
dependencies.#
====

This means, for example, that a UML classifier cannot be redefined in a new
extension. If a new version of the classifier is needed it has to be a valid subtype
of the original.

In terms of generalization, subclassing, extension and restriction (into a new class
or type) are all acceptable, redefinition (of an old class or type) is not.

[NOTE]
====
<<cls-6-3>> makes some pointed suggestion as to how to organize the conformance
classes and normative clauses in parallel to make this requirement easier to verify.

Most standards include examples, which are useful for illustrative or pedagogical
purposes. However, it is not possible to write a specification "by example" that
leads to conformance tests. Examples are therefore non-normative, by definition.
====

[[cls-6-5-3]]
==== Profiles are defined as sets of conformance classes

All the conformance classes created in a standard form a base (an upper bound
of all conformance classes) for defining profiles as defined in ISO/IEC 10000 (see
<<iso-dp2>>). The base for creating a profile can be defined as the union of all
requirements classes.

[[req-19]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The conformance tests for a profile of a standard SHALL be defined as the
union of a list of conformance classes that are to be satisfied by that profile's
standardization targets.#
====

NOTE: This means that a standard conformant to the ModSpec predefines all of its
possible profiles through the dependencies between the conformance classes. In
essence, a profile of a conformant standard is precisely a transitive closure of a
subset of requirements classes under the dependency relations. If a standard has "n"
requirements classes and they are all independent, it can have no more than "2^n^ --
1" profiles. If there is a core and "n" independent extensions, then there are no
more than "2^n^" profiles. Dependencies will usually decrease these numbers radically.

[[cls-6-5-4]]
==== There is a Defined Core

[[req-20]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Every specification SHALL define and identify a core set of requirements as a
separate conformance class.#
====

[[req-21]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#All general recommendations SHALL be in the core.#
====

[[req-22]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Every other requirements class in a standard shall SHALL a standardization
target type which is a subtype of that of the core and shall have the core as a
direct dependency.#
====

*#This core may be partially or totally abstract. The core should be as simple as
possible. The core requirements class may be a conformance class in another
standard, in which case the current standard should identify any optional tests
in that conformance class that are required by the current standard's core
requirements class.#* See <<req-13>>.

Since the core requirements class is contained (as a direct dependency) in each
other requirements class with a similar standardization target type, the general
recommendations are thus universal to all requirements classes. *#Since the basic
concept of some standards is mechanism not implementation, the core may contain only
recommendations, and include no requirements.#*

NOTE: In most cases, if someone feels the need to define a "simple" version of the
standard, it is probably a good approximation of the best core. For example, the
core of a refactored GML might be the equivalent of the "GML for Simple Features"
profile. The core for any SQL version of feature geometry is probably "Simple
Features."

[[cls-6-5-5]]
==== Extensions are requirements classes

A common mechanism to extend the functionality of a specification is to define
extensions, which may be either local or encompass other standards. *#Standards
should use extensions as required and feasible, but should never hinder them.#*

[[req-23]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#Each standard conformant to the ModSpec SHALL consist of the core and some
number of requirements classes defined as extensions to that core.#
====

[[req-24]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard conformant to the ModSpec SHALL require all conformant extensions
to itself to be conformant to this standard.#
====

Since software is evolutionary at its best, it would not be wise to restrict that
evolutionary tendency in a standard, by restricting the specification of extensions. A
good standrd will thus list the things a standardization target has to do, but
will never list things that a standardization target might want to do above and
beyond the current design requirements.

[[req-25]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#A standard conformant to the ModSpec SHALL never restrict in any manner
future, logically valid extensions of its standardization targets.#
====

*#The above requirement should not be interpreted as a restriction on quality
control.#* Any efforts by a standard to enforce a level of quality on its
standardization targets, when well and properly formed, do not interfere with the
proper extension of those targets. So, the standard may require its
standardization targets to behave in a certain manner when presented with a logical
inconsistency, but that inconsistency must be fundamental to the internal logic of
the model, and not a possible extension. Thus, a standard may require a
standardization target to accept GML as a feature specification language, but cannot
require a standardization target to not accept an alternative, such as KML, or
GeoJSON, as long at that alternative can carry viable information consistent with
the fundamental intent of the standard.

[[cls-6-5-6]]
==== Optional requirements are organized as requirements classes

[[req-26]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The only optional requirements acceptable in a standard conformant with the ModSpec SHALL be expressible as a list of conformance classes to be passed.#
====

NOTE: Standards and implementations are restricted by this, but not instances of
schemas. For example, a XML schema standard can specify an optional element, which
data instances may use or not. However schema-aware processors claiming conformance
to the standard should be able to handle all elements defined in the schema, whether
they are required by the schema or not.

*#Requirements of the form "if the implementation does this, it must do it this way"
are considered to be options and should be in a separate requirements class.#*

[[cls-6-5-7]]
==== Requirements classes intersect overlap only by reference

[[req-27]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
====
#The common portion of any two requirements classes SHALL consist only of references
to other requirements classes.#
====

This implies that each requirement is directly in exactly one requirements class and
all references to that requirement from another requirements class must include its
complete "home" requirements class. This means that requirements for dependencies
will often result in conformance test cases which require the execution of the
dependency conformance class. See for example <<annex-A-2-1>>.

NOTE: All general recommendations are in the core requirements class. The core
conformance test class contains tests that all other conformance classes must pass.
