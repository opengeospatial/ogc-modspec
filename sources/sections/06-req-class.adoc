== Requirements Class: Core

The following requirements specify the rules for the content and structure of a modular standard. These requirements are also known as the `core` of the ModSpec.

[[req-1]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ001* | */req/core/reqs-are-testable* +
All the parts of a requirement, a requirements module, or requirements class _SHALL_ be
testable. Failure to pass any part of any requirement shall be a failure to pass the
associated conformance test class.
|===

[NOTE]
====
This further means that failure to pass the test specified for a part of requirement is a
failure to pass the requirement.
====

[[req-2]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ002* | */req/core/all-components-assigned-uri* +
Each component of the standard, including requirements, requirements modules,
requirements classes, conformance test cases, conformance modules and conformance
classes _SHALL_ be assigned a URI. 
For OGC standards documents, these URIs SHALL be conformant with the https://www.ogc.org/about-ogc/policies/ogcna/[OGC Naming Authority policies].
|===

NOTE: In the OGC, the enforcement of this requirement and its associated recommendation is the purview of
the OGC Naming Authority or its equivalents.

[[rec-1]]
[recommendation,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REC001* | */req/core/uri-external-use* +
These URI identities _SHOULD_ be used in any external documentation that reference
these component elements in a normative manner, including but not limited to other
standards, implementations of the conformance test suite, or certificates of
conformance for implementations conformant to the standard in question.
|===

While a requirement may be referenced in more than one place in a standard, the normative definition of a requirement shall be its "*#home#*" (see <<cls-5-3>>) and
will be the only place where full normative language is used.

The following permissions relate to possible content specified in the core of a standard.

[[per-1]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER001* | */per/core/informational-content-in-core* +
The informational and structural universals of the standard _MAY_ be included in the
core text and its associated models without violations of the ModSpec. This is
true if the requirements of the extension are not implicit in what is
included in the core.
|===

In this manner, the core requirements class and its associated contents can be
thought of not only as the requirements of the core conformance class, but as a form
of reference model for establishing core vocabularies and schemas for the entire
standard.

[[per-2]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER002* | */per/core/core-may-contain-schema-terms* +
The core _MAY_ contain the definition and schema of commonly used terms and data
structures for use in other structures throughout the standard.
|===

[[per-3]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER003* | */per/core/core-names-of-operations* +
This may include the list of the names of all operations and operation parameters
to be used in any request-response pairs defined in any conformance class of the
standard. If a service receives a request that is not supported in its
conformance claim, then the service may return an error message text stating that the
requested operation is part of a non-supported extension.
|===

The following states how and where vocabularies are specified in relation to a requirement or requirements class.

[[req-3]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ003* | */req/core/vocabulary-and-parent-req-class* +
Requirements on the use and interpretation of vocabulary _SHALL_ be in the
requirements class where that use or interpretation is used.
|===

[[per-4]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER004* | */per/core/external-vocabs-core* +
Importation of external vocabularies and schemas _MAY_ be in the core.
|===

[example]
====
In the specification of a metadata service, the Dublin Core concept of a "Title" and
the XML schema structure used for its specification can be in the core of the service
specification. How a particular request-response pair uses the data structure to mean
the title of a particular document or dataset will be specified in the requirements
class in which the request-response pair is defined and set against requirements.
====

[[cls-6-2]]
=== Using the model

The primary difficulty in speaking about standards (or candidate
standards){blank}footnote:[This is purposely written as "as not yet adopted"
standards, since it is during the authoring process that the ModSpec must be
considered, not _post facto_.] as a group is their diverse
nature. Some standards use UML to define behavior, others use XML to define data
structures, and others use no specific modeling language at all. However, they all
must model the standardization target to which they apply since they need to use
unambiguous language to specify requirements. Thus, the only thing they have in
common is that they define testable requirements against some
model of an implementation of the standard (the standardization target). For
completeness, they should also specify the conformance tests for these requirements
that are to be run for validation of the implementations against those
requirements.

NOTE: This "test suite" specification is a requirement for
ISO and for OGC, but is often ignored in less formal standardization efforts. In such
cases, if there exists a "validation authority" for conformance, they must interpret
the requirements to be tested possibly separated from the authors of the
standard, leading to issues of separate interpretations of the same standard.

The assumption is that each standard has a single
(root) standardization target type from which all extensions inherit. If this is not
true, then the standard can be logically factored into parts each corresponding
to a "root" standardization target type, and that the standard addresses each
such part separately (see the definition of requirements class in
<<term-requirements-class>>). In this sense, the next requirement divides
standard into parts more than restricting their content.

[[req-4]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ004* | */req/core/single-standardization-target* +
Each requirement in a conformant standard _SHALL_ have a single standardization
target type.
|===

In practice, the standardization target of the core requirements class is the root
of an inheritance tree where extensions all have the core's target as an ancestor,
and thus can be considered as belonging to the same "class" or type as the core's
target.

[[req-5]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ005* | */req/core/modspec/test-class-single-standardization-target* +
All conformance tests in a single conformance test class in a conformant
standard _SHALL_ have the same standardization target.
|===

This means that all requirements are considered as targeting the same entity being
tested for a particular certificate of conformance. The test may specify other types
as intermediaries or indirect dependencies (see
<<term-indirect-dependency-(of-a-requirements-class)>>).

[[per-5]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER005* | */per/core/repeated-requirements* +
If needed, a requirement _MAY_ be repeated word for word in another requirement up
to but not including the identification of the standardization target type. 
|===

This second statement will be in a separate requirements class, since it will have a
separate standardization target and thus belong to the requirements to be tested by
a separate conformance class. For example, in a service interface, a standard
may be written that requires both the client and server to use a particular language
for data transmission. Since the client and server are different standardization
targets types (except in some special circumstances), they will have different
conformance test classes.

One solution is to state the requirement twice, once for each target. The most
common alternative is to introduce a new "superclass". 

[[per-6]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER006* | */per/core/abstract-superclass* +
The standard may introduce an abstract superclass of all affected standardization target types and
use this for the requirements common to all of the affected target types. This is
diagrammed in <<fig-6-1>>.
|===

[[cls-6-3]]
=== The "standards" document

Each standard document is comprised of a set of requirements and their associated conformance tests.

[[req-6]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ006* | */req/core/uml/requirements-grouped* +
Requirements SHALL be grouped together in clauses (numbered sections) of the
document in a strictly hierarchical manner, consistent with 
requirements classes.
|===

[[req-7]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ007* | */req/core/uml/requirements-test-suite-structure* +
The requirements structure of the document SHALL be in a logical correspondence to
the test suite structure.
|===

If two requirements are
in the same requirments class, they should be tested in the same conformance
class in the conformance suite. Each requirement is separately identifiable
either by a label as is done in the ModSpec.

In summary, the structure of the requirements and requirements classes of the model
should be reflected in the organization of the conformance tests and classes, and
also in the structure of the normative clauses in the specification document.

[[cls-6-4]]
=== Conformance Test Suite

The requirements specified in this clause will be applied directly to the test suite, and in particular
to the conformance classes. By definition, a "test suite" is a collection of
identifiable conformance classes. A conformance class is a well-defined set of
conformance tests. Each conformance test is a concrete or abstract (depending on the
type of suite) description of a test to be performed on each candidate conformant
implementation, to determine if it meets a well-defined set of requirements as
stated in the normative clauses of the standards document.

NOTE: The Test Suite is normative in the sense that it describes the tests to be
performed to pass conformance, but it specifies no requirements in any other sense.
The requirements are specified in the body of the standard. The test suite
only describes in detail how those requirements should be tested.

In each of the profiles defined in the Clauses to follow, some set of entities,
types, elements, or objects are defined and segregated into implementation
requirements classes.

[[req-8]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ008* | */req/core/uml/requirements-class-correspondence-to-conformance-classes* +
The requirements classes shall be in a one-to-one correspondence to the conformance test classes, 
and thus to the various certificate of conformance types possible for a candidate implementation. 
|===

Strict parallelism of implementation and governance is the essence of this standard.

=== Requirements for Modularity

[[cls-6-5-1]]
==== Each Conformance class tests a complete requirements class

[[req-9]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ009* | */req/core/uml/no-optional-tests* +
A Conformance class SHALL not contain any optional conformance tests.
|===

This requirement stops
conformance classes from containing optional requirements and tests, and, at least
as far as the standard is concerned, makes all certificates of conformance mean
that exactly the same tests have been conducted. Standards documents may use
recommendations for such options, but the conformance test classes do not test
recommendations.

[[per-7]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER007* | */per/core/uml/conf-class-paramterized* +
A Conformance class may be parameterized.
|===

This means that the class's tests
depend on some parameter that must be defined before the tests can be executed. This can
be thought of as an "if-then-else" decision tree. 

For example, if a conformance class needs to apply tests against a specific data format, such as GML or
KML, then XYZ(GML) is XYZ using GML, and XYZ(KML) is XYZ using KML.
Because the parameters choose which requirements will be tested, two conformance
classes with distinct parameters should be considered as distinct conformance
classes.

The most common parameters are the identities of indirect dependencies. For example,
if a service uses or produces feature data, the format of that data may be a
parameter, such as GML, KML or GeoJSON. When reading a certificate of conformance,
the values of such parameters are very important.

[[req-10]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ010* | */req/core/uml/all-parameters-expressed* +
A certificate of conformance SHALL specify all parameter values used to pass the
tests in its conformance test class.
|===

Conformance to a particular conformance class means exactly the same thing everywhere.

[[req-11]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ011* | */req/core/uml/conf-class-single-req-class* +
A Conformance class SHALL explicitly test only requirements from a single
requirements class.
|===

This means that there is a strict correspondence between the requirements classes
and the conformance test classes in the test suite. Recall that a conformance test
class may specify dependencies causing other conformance test classes to be used,
but this is a result of an explicit requirement in the "home" requirements class.

[[req-12]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ012* | */req/core/uml/con-class-dependencies* +
A Conformance class SHALL specify any other conformance class upon which it is
dependent and that other conformance class shall be used to test the specified
dependency.
|===

Such referenced conformance classes may be in the same standard or may be a
conformance class of another standard.

[[example-6-2]]
[example]
.Indirect dependency on schema
====
If a service specifies that a particular output is required to be conformant to a
conformance test class in a specific standard (say a normatively referenced XML
schema), then the conformance class of that normative reference will be used to test
that output. For example, if an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) implementation instance specifies that its feature collection output is
compliant to a particular profile of GML, then that profile of GML will be used to
validate that output. This means that the service is indirectly tested using the GML
standard. In other words, GML is an indirect dependency of the original service.
====

Requirements classes may be optional as a whole, but not piecemeal. This means that
every implementation that passed a particular conformance class satisfies exactly
the same requirements and passes exactly the same conformance tests. Differences
between implementations will be determined by which conformance test classes are
passed, not by listing of which options within a class were tested. If a
standard's authors wish to make a particular requirement optional, <<req-9>>
forces them to include it in a separate requirements class (and therefore in a
separate conformance test class) which can be left untested.

NOTE: Standards developed outside the OGC may not follow a strict parallelism between requirement specification
and testing, so for use within a standard compliant to the ModSpec, special
care must be taken in importing conformance test classes from other standards.

[[req-13]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ013* | */req/core/uml/imported-requirements-class* +
^| A | If a requirements class is imported from another standard for use within a
standard conformant to the ModSpec, and if any imported requirement is
"optional," then that requirement _SHALL_ be factored out as a separate requirements
class in the profile of that imported standard used in the conformant standard.
^| B | Each such used requirements class _SHALL_ be a conformance class of the source
standard or a combination of conformance classes of the source standard or standards.#
|===

The tracking of the parallelism between requirements and tests should be easy if the
standards document is non-ambiguous. To insure this, by utilizing the names of the two types of classes the following requirement places a
default mapping between the two.

[[req-14]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REQ014* | */req/core/uml/all-classes-explicitly-named* +
For the sake of consistency and readability, all requirements classes and all
conformance test classes _SHALL_ be explicitly named, with corresponding requirements
classes and conformance test classes having similar names.
|===

Logically, a requirements class (set of requirements) and a conformance class (set
of tests) are not comparable. This can be remedied by noting that both have a
consistent relation to a set of requirements. A requirements class is a set of
requirements. A conformance class tests a set of requirements. Therefore a requirements class corresponds precisely to a conformance class if they
both are related (as described) to the same set of requirements.


[[cls-6-5-2]]
==== Requirements classes contain all requirements tested by a conformance test case

[[req-15]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ015* | */req/core/uml/req-in-only-one-rec-class* +
^| A | Each requirement in the standard _SHALL_ be contained in one and only one
requirements class. 
^| B | Inclusion of any requirement in a requirements class by a
conformance class _SHALL imply inclusion of all requirements in its class (as a
dependency).
|===

Unless a requirement is referenced in a conformance test and thus in a conformance
class, it cannot be considered a requirement since no test has been defined for it.

[[rec-2]]
[recommendation,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REC002* | */req/core/uml/parallel-structure* +
If possible, the structure of the normative clauses of the standard _SHOULD_
parallel the structure of the conformance classes in the conformance clause.
|===

The above requirement in conjunction with <<req-9>> means that all requirements in a conformant
standard will be tested in some conformance class. In the best example, a
requirement should be contained explicitly in one and only one requirements class
and tested in one and only one conformance class. This is not really a requirement
here, since a single requirement can be stated twice in different requirements
classes.

[[req-16]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ016* | */req/core/uml/co-dependent-requirements* +
^| A | If any two requirements are co-dependent (each
dependent on the other) then they shall be in the same requirements class. 
^| B | If any
two requirements classes are co-dependent, they shall be merged into a single class.
|===

Normally, circular dependencies between implementation components are signs of a
poor design, but they often cannot be avoided because of other considerations (code
ownership for example). 

[[rec-3]]
[recommendation,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REC003* | */req/core/uml/circular-dependencies* +
Circular dependencies of all types should be avoided whenever possible.
|===

[[req-17]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
*REQ017* | */req/core/uml/structure-requirements-classes* +
There _SHALL_ be a natural structure to the requirements classes so that each may be
implemented on top of any implementations of its dependencies and independent of its
extensions.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The only certain manner to test this requirement maybe to create a reference
implementation.
====

This requirement is more important and may be more difficult than it seems. It
states simply that conformance classes and their associated requirements classes can
be put in a one-to-one correspondence to a fully modular implementation of the
complete standard (at least against a single
standardization target). Implementors who wish to sacrifice modularity for some
other benefit can still do what they want; the requirement here only states that if
the software requirements classes are properly separated, they can be implemented in
a "plug'n'play" fashion.


[[req-18]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ018* | */req/core/uml/requirements-and-dependencies* +
No requirements class _SHALL_ redefine the requirements of its dependencies, unless
that redefinition is for an entity derived from but not contained in those
dependencies.#
|===

This means, for example, that a UML classifier cannot be redefined in a new
extension. If a new version of the classifier is needed it has to be a valid subtype
of the original.

In terms of generalization, subclassing, extension and restriction (into a new class
or type) are all acceptable, redefinition (of an old class or type) is not.

<<cls-6-3>> makes some pointed suggestion as to how to organize the conformance
classes and normative clauses in parallel to make this requirement easier to verify.

Most standards include examples, which are useful for illustrative or pedagogical
purposes. However, it is not possible to write a standard "by example" that
leads to conformance tests. Examples are therefore non-normative, by definition.


[[cls-6-5-3]]
==== Profiles are defined as sets of conformance classes

All the conformance classes created in a standard form a base (an upper bound
of all conformance classes) for defining profiles as defined in ISO/IEC 10000 (see
<<iso-dp2>>). The base for creating a profile can be defined as the union of all
requirements classes.

[[req-19]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ019* | */req/core/uml/profile-conformance* +
The conformance tests for a profile of a standard _SHALL_ be defined as the
union of a list of conformance classes that are to be satisfied by that profile's
standardization targets.
|===

[[cls-6-5-4]]
==== There is a Defined Core

[[req-20]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ020* | */req/core/uml/core-requirements-separate* +
Every standard _SHALL_ define and identify a core set of requirements as a
separate conformance class.
|===

[[req-21]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ021* | */req/core/uml/requirements-and-dependencies* +
All general recommendations _SHALL_ be in the core.
|===

[[req-22]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ022* | */req/core/uml/requirements-and-dependencies* +
^| A |Every other requirements class in a standard _SHALL_ a standardization
target type which is a subtype of that of the core 
^| B | And every requirement class _SHALL_ have the core as a direct dependency.
|===

[[rec-4]]
[recommendation,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REC004* | */req/core/uml/simple-core* +
The core _SHOULD_ be as simple as possible.
|===

[[per-8]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER008* | */per/core/uml/core-type* +
The core _MAY_ be partially or totally abstract.
|===

[[per-9]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER009* | */per/core/uml/req-class-another-standard* +
The core requirements class _MAY_ be a conformance class in another standard.
|===

[[rec-5]]
[recommendation,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*REC005* | */req/core/uml/optional-tests* +
If a requirements class is from another standard, the current standard _SHOULD_ identify any optional tests
in that conformance class that are required by the current standard's core requirements class. See <<req-13>>.
|===

Since the core requirements class is contained (as a direct dependency) in each
other requirements class with a similar standardization target type, the general
recommendations are thus universal to all requirements classes. 

[[per-10]]
[permission,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
|*PER010* | */per/core/uml/core-maybe-recommendations* +
Since the basic concept of some standards is mechanism not implementation, the core _MAY_ contain only
recommendations, and include no requirements.
|===

NOTE: In most cases, if someone feels the need to define a "simple" version of the
standard, it is probably a good approximation of the best core. For example, the
core of a refactored GML might be the equivalent of the "GML for Simple Features"
profile. The core for any SQL version of feature geometry is probably "Simple
Features."

[[cls-6-5-5]]
==== Extensions are requirements classes

A common mechanism to extend the functionality of a standard is to define
extensions, which may be either local or encompass other standards. 

*#Standards
should use extensions as required and feasible, but should never hinder them.#*

[[req-23]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ023* | */req/core/uml/core-and-extensions* +
Each standard conformant to the ModSpec _SHALL_ consist of the core and some
number of requirements classes defined as extensions to that core.
|===

[[req-24]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ024* | */req/core/uml/extensions-conformant-to-the-modspec* +
A standard conformant to the ModSpec _SHALL_ require all conformant extensions
to itself to be conformant to the ModSpec.
|===

Since software is evolutionary at its best, it would not be wise to restrict that
evolutionary tendency by restricting the specification of extensions. A
good standard will thus list the things a standardization target has to do, but
will never list things that a standardization target might want to do above and
beyond the current design requirements.

[[req-25]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ025* | */req/core/uml/restriction-of-extensions* +
A standard conformant to the ModSpec _SHALL_ never restrict in any manner
future, logically valid extensions of its standardization targets.
|===

The above requirement should not be interpreted as a restriction on quality
control. Any efforts by a standard to enforce a level of quality on its
standardization targets, when well and properly formed, do not interfere with the
proper extension of those targets. So, the standard may require its
standardization targets to behave in a certain manner when presented with a logical
inconsistency, but that inconsistency must be fundamental to the internal logic of
the model, and not a possible extension. Thus, a standard may require a
standardization target to accept GML as a feature specification language, but cannot
require a standardization target to not accept an alternative, such as KML, or
GeoJSON, as long at that alternative can carry viable information consistent with
the fundamental intent of the standard.

[[cls-6-5-6]]
==== Optional requirements are organized as requirements classes

[[req-26]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ026* | */req/core/uml/optional requirements* +
The only conditional requirements acceptable in a standard conformant with the ModSpec _SHALL_ be expressible as a list of conformance classes to be passed.
|===

NOTE: Standards and implementations are restricted by this, but not instances of
schemas. For example, a XML schema standard can specify an optional element, which
data instances may use or not. However schema-aware processors claiming conformance
to the standard should be able to handle all elements defined in the schema, whether
they are required by the schema or not.

*#Requirements of the form "if the implementation does this, it must do it this way"
are considered to be options and should be in a separate requirements class.#*

[[cls-6-5-7]]
==== Requirements classes intersect overlap only by reference

[[req-27]]
[requirement,model=ogc,type="general"]
[width="90%",cols="2,6"]
|===
^|*REQ027* | */req/core/uml/req-class-overlap-by-reference* +
The common portion of any two requirements classes _SHALL_ consist only of references
to other requirements classes.
|===

This implies that each requirement is directly in exactly one requirements class and
all references to that requirement from another requirements class must include its
complete "home" requirements class. This means that requirements for dependencies
will often result in conformance test cases which require the execution of the
dependency conformance class. See for example <<annex-A-2-1>>.

NOTE: All general recommendations are in the core requirements class. The core
conformance test class contains tests that all other conformance classes must pass.
