== ModSpec UML Model, semantics, and Definitions

=== Semantically ordered definitions

<<cls-4,Clause 4>> formally defines the terms used in the conformance tests in alphabetical
order. It may be easier to understand the more significant terms in the following
less formal definitions arranged in a bottom-up order:

. a {{standardization target type}} is a type of entity about which a standard
is written. An instance of a {{standardization target type}} is a
{{standardization target}}. A standard may address multiple targets in separate
<<conformance-class,_conformance classes_>>.

. a {{requirement}} is a statement of a condition to be satisfied by a single
{{standardization target type}}, and it must be stated in "normative" language.

. a {{conformance test}} checks if a set of
{{requirement,requirements}} are met (*pass*) or not met (*fail*) by a
{{standardization target}}. The relationship between {{conformance test,
conformance tests}} and {{requirement,requirements}} is many-to-many.

. all {{conformance test, conformance tests}} are graded as *pass* or *fail*
against each instance of the {{standardization target}}.

. a {{requirement}} is associated to one {{conformance test}}.

. a {{recommendation}} is a suggestion and is not associated to any
{{conformance test}}.

. a {{requirements class}} is a set of one or more {{requirement,requirements}}
all with the same {{standardization target type}}.

. a {{conformance test class,conformance (test) class}} is a collection of
{{conformance test,conformance tests}} that are associated to and only to the
requirements in a corresponding {{requirements class}}.

. a {{conformance test module,conformance (test) module}} is also collection of
{{conformance test classes,conformance test classes}} that group
{{conformance test, conformance tests}} on a single
{{standardization target type}}.

. a *conformant implementation* is a {{standardization target type}} that has
successfully passed all tests in a specified {{conformance test
class,conformance (test) class}} and received a {{certificate of conformance}}

. the {{core requirements class}} of a standard is the minimal set of
{{requirement,requirements}} which must be supported by all *conformant
implementations*. If a standard addresses multiple {{standardization target
type,standardization target types}}, it may have a *core* for each *target
type*.

. an *extension* of a {{requirements class}} is an additional {{requirements class}}
(the extension) that adds additional {{requirement,requirements}} to the first
{{requirements class}} (the *base requirements class* being extended). The
extension is said to be dependent on the *base*. Any {{conformance test class}}
must identify all its dependencies during the execution of conformance tests
against a candidate {{standardization target}}.
