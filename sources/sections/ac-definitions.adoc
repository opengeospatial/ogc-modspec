== ModSpec UML Model, Semantics, and Definitions

=== Semantically ordered definitions

<<cls-4,Clause 4>> formally defines the terms used in the conformance tests in alphabetical
order. It may be easier to understand the more significant terms in the following
less formal definitions arranged in a bottom-up order:

. a <<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target type_>> is a type of entity about which a standard
is written. An instance of a <<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target type_>> is a
<<StandardizationTarget-definition,_standardization target_>>. A standard may address multiple targets in separate
<<ConformanceClass-definition,_conformance classes_>>.

. a <<Requirement-definition,_requirement_>> is a statement of a condition to be satisfied by a single
<<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target type_>>, and it must be stated in "normative" language.

. a <<ConformanceTest-definition,_conformance test_>> checks if a 
<<Requirement-definition,_requirement_>> including its parts are met (*pass*) or not met (*fail*) by a
<<StandardizationTarget-definition,_standardization target_>>.

. all <<ConformanceTest-definition,_conformance tests_>> are graded as *pass* or *fail*
against each instance of the <<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target type_>>.

. a <<Requirement-definition,_requirement_>> is associated to one <<ConformanceTest-definition,_conformance test_>>.

. a <<Recommendation-definition,_recommendation_>> is a suggestion and is not associated to any
<<ConformanceTest-definition,_conformance test_>>.

. a <<RequirementsClass-definition,_requirements class_>> is a set of one or more <<Requirement-definition,_requirements_>>
all with the same <<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target type_>>.

. a <<ConformanceClass-definition,_conformance (test) class_>> is a collection of
<<ConformanceTest-definition,_conformance tests_>> that are associated to and only to the
requirements in a corresponding <<RequirementsClass-definition,_requirements class_>>.

. a <<ConformancePackage-definition,_conformance (test) package_>> is a reusable collection of related <<ConformanceClass-definition,_conformance test classes_>>.

. a *conformant implementation* is a <<StandardizationTarget-definition,_standardization target_>> that has
successfully passed all tests in a specified <<ConformanceClass-definition,_conformance (test) class_>> and received a <<CertificateOfConformance-definition,_certificate of conformance_>>.

. the <<CoreRequirementsClass-definition,_Core requirements class_>> of a standard is the minimal set of
<<Requirement-definition,_requirements_>> which must be supported by all *conformant
implementations*. If a standard addresses multiple <<StandardizationTargetType-definition,_standardization target types_>>, it may have a *core* for each *target
type*.

. an *extension* of a <<RequirementsClass-definition,_requirements class_>> is an additional <<RequirementsClass-definition,_requirements class_>>
(the extension) that adds additional <<Requirement-definition,_requirements_>> to the first
<<RequirementsClass-definition,_requirements class_>> (the *base requirements class* being extended). The
extension is said to be dependent on the *base*. Any <<ConformanceClass-definition,_conformance (test) class_>>
must identify all its dependencies during the execution of conformance tests
against a candidate <<StandardizationTarget-definition,_standardization target_>>.
