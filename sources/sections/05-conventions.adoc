=== Finding requirements and recommendations

Each normative statement in the ModSpec is stated in one and only one place,
in a standard format, and has an unique label, such as REQ001, REC001, or PER001. A requirement, recommendation, or permission may be repeated for clarification. 
The statement with the unique label is
considered the official statement of the normative requirement or recommendation. 

In this document, all requirements are associated with tests specified in the abstract test suite
in <<annex-A>>. The reference to the requirement in the test case is done by a
requirements label (in the form "*#Req &#x23;#*", where "&#x23;" is a number) associated to
the *#home#* of the statement described above. Recommendations are
not tested although they still are documented using a standard template and have unique identifiers.

Requirements classes are separated into their own clauses and named, and specified
according to inheritance (direct dependencies). The Conformance test classes in the
test suite are similarly named to establish an explicit and link between
requirements classes and conformance test classes.
