= Introduction to key ModSpec concepts with examples

This section describes and provides examples of the key concepts of the ModSpec.

=== Requirement

`requirement` is a fundamental concept. A requirement clearly states a condition (rule) to be satisfied in any implementation of the standard. 
A requirement must be stated in “normative” language. In the OGC, the use of the word `SHALL` indicates that a requirement is being presented.
Other standards organizations use the verb `MUST` to indicate a requirement is being stated. An example of a requirement is:

```
An implementation `SHALL` specify a coordinate reference system (CRS)
```

Now, the above example is fairly nebulous and open to interpretation as to how the CRS is identified and expressed. Therefore, the ModSpec states that
a requirement  `MAY` be stated as one or more `parts` where each part specified additional rules for that requirement. Expanding the above example:

```
An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS). An EPSG code SHALL be used to 
indentify the CRS. The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI)  
such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
```

The above multi-part statement of the CRS requirement could be split into three separate requirements. However, for clarity and readability, a multipart requirement
may be a better choice.

The ModSpec further states that any requirement `SHALL` be uniquely identified and/or labeled. For example, the above 
requirement could be labeled `Requirement 1`. The above requirement could also be idnetified by a URI such as http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-2/1.0/req/crs.
In the OGC, requirements are  labeled and have a unique indentifier (URI). So the above CRS example could be written as below and be compliant with the requirements
of the ModSpec

```
Label: Requirement 1
Identifier: http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-2/1.0/req/crs
An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS). An EPSG code SHALL be used to 
indentify the CRS. The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI)  
such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
```

==== Template for a requirement

To ensure that all standards documents have the same look and feel, a standard (consistent) template should be used for stating requirements.
The ModSpec does not specify any templates for how a requirement is specified - only the what the content is. In the OGC, requirements are specified 
using an AsciiDoc template. This is because in the OGC, all standards documentation is done using GitHub capabilities. 
The OGC has standardized on Metanorma for document publication. 

The following AsciiDoc examples both work in the OGC publication process. The first is the `traditional` OGC AsciiDoc template and the second is formatted specifically for the Metanorma publication process.

==== OGC Traditional AsciiDoc encoding example

```

|===
^|*Requirement 1* | */req/core/crs* +
^| A | An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS).
^| B | An EPSG code SHALL be used to indentify the CRS. 
^| C | The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI) such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
|===
```

==== Metanorma encoding example 

```
[[req-1]]
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/core/crs
part:: An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS).
part:: An EPSG code SHALL be used to indentify the CRS.
part:: The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI) such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
====
```

The above requirement example, formatted for Metanorma, does not have the requirement label such as Requirement 1. 
The label is generated during the Metanorma publication process. Also note that `[[req-1]]` is a bookmark.

Below is how these two examples would look after document publication:

^|*Requirement 1* | */req/core/crs* +
^| A | An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS).
^| B | An EPSG code SHALL be used to indentify the CRS. 
^| C | The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI) such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
