= Introduction to key ModSpec concepts with examples

This section describes and provides examples of the key concepts of the ModSpec.

=== Requirement

`requirement` is a fundamental concept. A requirement clearly states a condition (rule) to be satisfied in any implementation of the standard. 
A requirement must be stated in “normative” language. In the OGC, the use of the word `SHALL` indicates that a requirement is being presented.
Other standards organizations use the verb `MUST` to indicate a requirement is being stated. An example of a requirement is:

```
An implementation `SHALL` specify a coordinate reference system (CRS)
```

Now, the above example is fairly nebulous and open to interpretation as to how the CRS is identified and expressed. Therefore, the ModSpec states that
a requirement  `MAY` be stated as one or more `parts` where each part specified additional rules for that requirement. Expanding the above example:

```
An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS). An EPSG code SHALL be used to 
indentify the CRS. The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI)  
such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
```

The above multi-part statement of the CRS requirement could be split into three separate requirements. However, for clarity and readability, a multipart requirement
may be a better choice.

The ModSpec further states that any requirement `SHALL` be uniquely identified and/or labeled. For example, the above 
requirement could be labeled `Requirement 1`. The above requirement could also be idnetified by a URI such as http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-2/1.0/req/crs.
In the OGC, requirements are  labeled and have a unique indentifier (URI). So the above CRS example could be written as below and be compliant with the requirements
of the ModSpec

```
Label: *Requirement 1*
Identifier: http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-2/1.0/req/crs
An implementation SHALL specify a coordinate reference system (CRS). An EPSG code SHALL be used to 
indentify the CRS. The CRS SHALL be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (i.e., a URI)  
such as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326
```
