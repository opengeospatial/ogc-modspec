== Conformance

Conformance to the ModSpec: Part 2 - UML Standard by technical implementation standards 
can be tested by inspection. The test suite is in <<annex-A>>.

There is one conformance class for this document for:

. Standards using UML to state requirements, extending the core.

This document contains normative language and thus places requirements on
conformance, or mechanism for adoption, of candidate standards to which the ModSpec
applies. In particular:

* The core requirements which shall be met by all conformant
standards.
* The various subclauses of <<cls-6>> list requirements partially derived from the
core, but more specific to the conditions where the data model is expressed in UML. This requirements class is an
extension of the Core presented in the ModSpec Core Standard <<cls-6>>.
