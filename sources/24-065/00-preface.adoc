== Preface

This OGC member developed and approved document, referred to as the `ModSpec: Part 2 - UML`, defines an optional requirements class for UML

The ModSpec: Core Standard defines a model and related requirements 
and recommendations for writing and structuring modular standards documents. Further, this model is designed to enable 
consistent and verifiable testing of implementations of a standard that claim conformance. The ModSpec is a meta-standard: 
A standard specifying requirements for crafting and documenting modular and testable standards. 

The goals of using the ModSpec are:

- To define characteristics and a structure for the development of modular standards which will minimize the difficulty in writing testable standards while maximizing usability and interoperability.
- To ensure that a standard specifies requirements in a common and consistent manner and that these requirements are testable.

NOTE: Historically, this document has been known and abbreviated as the "ModSpec". For continuity and ease of understanding this document may also be referred to as the "OGC ModSpec".

== Document terms and definitions

This document uses the standard terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 05-008], which
is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Rules for the structure and drafting of
International Standards. In particular, the word "shall" (not "must") is the
imperative verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to
conform to this standard.
