== Conventions

=== Symbols (and abbreviated terms)

All symbols used in this document are either:

. Common mathematical symbols
. UML 2 (Unified Modeling Language) as defined by OMG and accepted as a publicly
available standard (PAS) by ISO in its earlier 1.3 version.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this standard are denoted by the URI namespace

https://www.opengis.net/spec/modspec/1.1/

All requirements that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to the namespace shown above.

For the sake of brevity, the use of “req” in a requirement URI denotes:

https://www.opengis.net/spec/modspec/1.1/

An example might be:

/req/core/crs

All conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to the namespace shown above.

For the sake of brevity, the use of “conf” in a requirement URI denotes:

https://www.opengis.net/spec/modspec/1.1/

The same convention is used for permissions (per) and recommendations (rec).

=== Abbreviations

=== Finding requirements and recommendations

Each normative statement in the ModSpec Part 2 - UML Standard is stated in one and only one place,
in a standard format, and with an unique label, such as REQ001, REC001, or PER001. A requirement, recommendation, or permission may be repeated for clarification. 
The statement with the unique label is considered the official statement of the normative requirement or recommendation. 

In this document, all requirements are associated with tests specified in the test suite
in <<annex-A>>. The reference to the requirement in the test case is done by a
requirements label Recommendations are not tested although they still are documented using a standard template and have unique identifiers.

Requirements classes are separated into their own clauses and named, and specified
according to inheritance (direct dependencies). The Conformance test classes in the
test suite are similarly named to establish an explicit and link between
requirements classes and conformance test classes.
