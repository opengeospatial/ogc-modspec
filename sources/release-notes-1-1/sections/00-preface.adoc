[abstract]
== Abstract

The OGC `ModSpec` defines a model and related requirements and recommendations for writing and structuring modular standards documents. Further, this model is designed to enable the consistent and verifiable testing of implementations of a standard that claim conformance.

The goal is to ensure that a standard specifies requirements in a common and consistent manner and that these requirements are testable.

NOTE: Historically, this document has been known and abbreviated as the "ModSpec". For continuity and ease of understanding this document may also be referred to as the "OGC ModSpec".

For OGC Standards work, the word “standard” in the ModSpec applies to all OGC draft standards, approved standards, draft Abstract Specifications, and approved Abstract Specifications. The exceptions are OGC Abstract Specifications that originate in ISO or Community Standards that are developed external to the OGC and then submitted to the OGC.

The goal of this Policy is to ensure that a standard specifies requirements in a common and consistent manner and that these requirements are testable.
