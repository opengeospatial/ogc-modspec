== Scope

The OGC ModSpec Standard defines characteristics and structure for the specification of Standards 
that will encourage implementation by minimizing difficulty determining
requirements, mimicking implementation structure and maximizing usability and
interoperability. Part 3 of the ModSpec defines the requirements for using XML. 
The XML related requirements classes cover any standard which has as one of its purposes
the introduction of a new XML schema. Such a standard would normally define the
schema, all of its components, and its intended uses.

=== Introduction

==== Semantics

The ModSpec Core Standard defines requirements for conformance to the ModSpec, but
testing for that conformance may depend on how the various forms and parts of a
conformant standard are viewed. The ModSpec Part 3 Standard specifies how those views
are to be defined as XML. 

As suggested in Clause Requirement 8 of the ModSpec Core, the structure of the normative clauses in a
standard should parallel the structure of the conformance test classes in
that standard. The structure of the normative clauses in a well written
standard will follow the structure of its model. This means that all three are
parallel.

==== ModSpec document structure

Version 1.1 of the ModSpec is split into a Core standard and multiple Parts. These are:

- Part 1: Core - contains all the core requirements and informational text that define the model and internal structure of a standard.
- Part 2 - UML Model requirements 
- Part 3 - XML Model and Schematron requirements
