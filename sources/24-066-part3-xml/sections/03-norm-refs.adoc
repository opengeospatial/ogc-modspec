== Normative references

While the ModSpec Part 1 Standard references UML and its technical specification,
no requirements are derived from these documents. While this document
may be applied to extensions of those standards, conformance to them is the purview
of those standards, not the ModSpec.

The following are normative references for this document in the sense that they
supplied definitions used in this document.
