</li>
<li><p id="_16c8a2ed-c7db-fdbf-85c4-e8cd241e1b44">Defines requirements for specifying the structure of a standards document as organized sets of criteria, those that are to be tested (“requirements”) and those that are not tested (“recommendations” and “permissions”).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p id="_8b501f32-fe29-b6d7-e78a-6da58ed1f31e">The goal of this approach is to enable implementations of a standard to be tested and deemed <em>conformant</em> or not.<note id="_0505c13e-c790-abcc-61e1-fdb450d998ee"><p id="_b14083bb-b16e-c8ad-b959-57f42f0ff655">Please note that the ModSpec has been approved by the OGC Membership as a policy directive for the development and revision of any OGC Standard or Abstract Specification that has requirements. However, the ModSpec is written to be non-OGC specific and can be used by any Standards Development Organization (SDO) as a formal guide for structuring a standards document.</p>
</note></p>



<p id="_9542aba3-2f4a-85b9-ccde-40e267850080">A standard that follows the rules specified in the ModSpec presents requirements organized in requirements classes which must be satisfied by passing the tests defined in a conformance suite (also known as the Abstract Test Suite in an OGC Standard). These tests are organized into conformance classes, each of which represents a mechanism for partial satisfaction of the standard. This results in a standard having a modular structure, where each requirements class has a corresponding conformance (test) class. In a well written standard, the normative clauses and any model or schema are organized in a manner that parallels the requirements and conformance clauses. A goal of the design pattern is the ability to define requirements classes and associated conformance classes that can be used across multiple standards.</p>

<p id="_13423764-864a-d877-5f7f-b7243947c191">There are numerous examples of requirements/conformance classes that can be used not only in OGC Standards, but for geospatially focused standards defined by other organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). Some OGC examples can be found in the <link target="https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html">OGC API — Common Part 1: Core Standard</link> and in the <link target="https://github.com/opengeospatial/cdbswg/blob/master/cdb-2.0/cdb-core-crs-requirements-class.adoc">CDB 2.0 Standard CRS Requirements Module</link>. By formally implementing the requirements specified in the ModSpec, reusable, modular standards can be developed.</p>

<clause id="_conformance_requirements_and_key_information" obligation="normative">
<title>Conformance, Requirements, and key information</title>
<p id="_e35e0a5f-4265-278b-c240-d528e301d6cb">In the conformance test suite there will be a test defined to verify the validity of
the claim that an implementation of the standard (standardization target) satisfies
each mandatory requirement specified in the standard. Since the normative language of the body of the standard and the
conformance test classes both define what conformance to the standard means, they
will be equivalent in a well-written standard. The ModSpec requires
a standards document to be well-written, at least in stating requirements and conformance
tests.</p>

<p id="_18cb355c-b5f0-e8cd-b27f-90c5e0d3f1e6">Conformance tests are aggregated into conformance classes that specify how certain
“certificates of conformance” are achieved. The natural inclination is to aggregate
the requirements. The issue that blocks this approach is that some requirements are
optional while others are mandatory. To achieve a cleaner separation of requirements,
the ModSpec separates them into sets (called “requirements classes”), each of which
has no optional components. Since the normative statement of each requirement is only
declared once and is uniquely identified as such, each requirement will be in a clause associated to its requirements class.</p>

<p id="_c5eb1f53-f036-9c5a-4c1c-34f88f839af9">Therefore, the ModSpec defines a “requirements class” as a set of requirements that must
all be passed to achieve a particular conformance class (see
<xref target="term-conformance-test-class"/>). This document also includes a “middle” structure
called a conformance test module. Requirements modules
parallel the conformance test modules. A standard written to the ModSpec may
use this “module” structure in any manner consistent with the rest of this Policy.</p>

<p id="_99302951-b148-d6c9-8704-36380f31372d">A standard may have mandatory and optional requirements classes.  This allows the options
in the testing procedure to be grouped into non-varying mandatory and optional conformance classes.
Each requirement within an optional requirements class is mandatory when that requirements class is
implemented. When needed, a particular requirements class may contain only a single
requirement.</p>

<p id="_f5ab911d-c704-6610-f838-79abc43de887">However, care must be taken, since the requirements classes may not always in a one-to-one
correspondence to conformance classes in other standards which may be the source of
requirements for a standard conformant to this Policy. If other standards are
used, their options shall be specified to be useable within a standard conformant to
this policy, see <xref target="cls-6-5-1"/>.</p>

<p id="_adb67821-40e0-909d-4c4d-c50653e941f4">Conformance classes may contain dependencies on one another. These are represented by
tests in one conformance class that state that another conformance class must be
passed to qualify to pass this conformance class. In terms of requirements, that says
that the dependent conformance class contains tests (by reference) for all
requirements of the “included” conformance class.</p>

<p id="_6ec0aa98-2cd7-426b-47b3-e4f28b97e296">As defined in the ModSpec, one requirements
class is dependent on another if the other is included through such a reference. In
this manner, requirements classes can be treated as sets of requirements (each in a
single requirements class but included in others by reference to its “home”
requirements class).</p>

<p id="_fe729571-b501-f15c-239d-33cdbb9b7e79">In the ModSpec, each conformance requirement is separated in its own labeled
paragraph, such as <xref target="req-1"/> above.</p>

<p id="_13d9ed6b-4619-88a7-c409-ae45d96e20a7">The distribution of the information in a standard is not restricted. The only
requirement is that requirements be grouped in a manner
consistent with the conformance test classes, see <xref target="req-6"/> and <xref target="req-7"/>.</p>

<title>Building Blocks</title>
<p id="_0f704161-06d3-c595-ecab-f9d39e84a76e">In software development technology, there is a concept called <em>building block</em>. In software development, building blocks are used to support the software build process where source code files/libraries can be accessed from multiple sources, converted into executable code, and linked together in the proper order until a complete set of executable files is generated. The same concept can be applied to OGC Standards development: Requirements classes and/or modules can be linked together from one or more standards to create a new standard not originally envisioned when the requirements were originally defined.</p>

This is a concise statement of the problem that the Standard helps address and the strategy envisioned for achieving a solution.  This strategy typically identifies real-world entities that need to be modified or constrained.  At the abstract level, those entities are the Standardization Target Types.  These are the classes of entities to be standardized. A Standard defines the requirements levied on one or more Standardization Target Types.</p>

<p id="_db2ef1cd-6b66-ebfb-72ac-3efdbc55eb47">Instances of a Standardization Target Type are the Standardization Targets.  These are the real-world manifestations of the Standardization Target Type.  In summary:</p>

The Standardization Target Types, Standardization Targets, and Standardization Goal provide a well-defined context for the standard.

It also will help keep Standards developers focused on the intended use of their standards, avoiding standards which are overly broad and/or unfocused.</p>

<clause id="_conformance_requirements_and_key_information_2" obligation="normative">
<title>Conformance, Requirements, and key information</title>
<p id="_9117e552-9b2b-b3ed-5381-864fe5f17212">In the conformance test suite, there will be a test defined to verify the validity of
the claim that an implementation of the standard (standardization target) satisfies
each mandatory requirement specified in the standard. Since the normative language of the body of the standard and the
conformance test classes both define what conformance to the standard means, they
will be equivalent in a well-written standard. The ModSpec requires
a standards document to be well-written, at least in stating requirements and conformance
tests.</p>

<p id="_449db982-c6e3-e2c2-5434-14c79876062d">Conformance tests are aggregated into conformance classes that specify how certain
“certificates of conformance” are achieved. The natural inclination is to aggregate
the requirements. The issue that blocks this approach is that some requirements are
optional while others are mandatory. To achieve a cleaner separation of requirements,
the ModSpec separates them into sets (called “requirements classes”), each of which
has no optional components. Since the normative statement of each requirement is only
declared once and is uniquely identified as such, each requirement will be in a clause associated to its requirements class.</p>

<p id="_d28fd8c0-22d0-0c24-8019-40a3ddb879f7">Therefore, the ModSpec defines a “requirements class” as a set of requirements that must
all be passed to achieve a particular conformance class (see
<xref target="term-conformance-test-class"/>). This document also includes a “middle” structure
called a conformance test module. Requirements modules
parallel the conformance test modules. A standard written to the ModSpec may
use this “module” structure in any manner consistent with the rest of this Policy.</p>

<p id="_7009dd4a-ac42-44b2-ed85-68c3b52b07c2">A standard may have mandatory and optional requirements classes.  This allows the options
in the testing procedure to be grouped into non-varying mandatory and optional conformance classes.
Each requirement within an optional requirements class is mandatory when that requirements class is
implemented. When needed, a particular requirements class may contain only a single
requirement.</p>

<p id="_c495f023-4228-f0b6-d02c-ecead2cf1351">However, care must be taken, since the requirements classes may not always in a one-to-one
correspondence to conformance classes in other standards which may be the source of
requirements for a standard conformant to the ModSpec. If other standards are
used, their options shall be specified to be useable within a standard conformant to
this policy, see <xref target="cls-6-5-1"/>.</p>

<p id="_d07c8102-1fdb-91b6-3254-8341e3bd4679">Conformance classes may contain dependencies on one another. These are represented by
tests in one conformance class that state that another conformance class must be
passed to qualify to pass this conformance class. In terms of requirements, that says
that the dependent conformance class contains tests (by reference) for all
requirements of the “included” conformance class.</p>

<p id="_579a86d0-ee2e-a1c9-ceda-9b94145e7151">As defined in the ModSpec, one requirements
class is dependent on another if the other is included through such a reference. In
this manner, requirements classes can be treated as sets of requirements (each in a
single requirements class but included in others by reference to its “home”
requirements class).</p>

<p id="_c75ec73b-db23-fa12-f049-07ab3c1ef312">In the ModSpec, each conformance requirement is separated in its own labeled

unambiguous language to specify requirements. Thus, the only thing they have in
common is that they define testable requirements against some
model of an implementation of the standard (the standardization target). For
completeness, they should also specify the conformance tests for these requirements

<p id="_eb47060d-257b-38de-ca94-49e7d953152d">The requirements specified in this clause will be applied directly to the test suite, and in particular
to the conformance classes. By definition, a “test suite” is a collection of
identifiable conformance classes. A conformance class is a well-defined set of
conformance tests. Each conformance test is a concrete or abstract (depending on the
type of suite) description of a test to be performed on each candidate conformant
implementation, to determine if it meets a well-defined set of requirements as
stated in the normative clauses of the standards document.<note id="_820fcba2-43b8-dc6f-65d3-c0b34d513ac5"><p id="_60b7e2d3-d948-9364-469d-cbe582b1ae33">The Test Suite is normative in the sense that it describes the tests to be
performed to pass conformance, but it specifies no requirements in any other sense.
The requirements are specified in the body of the standard. The test suite
only describes in detail how those requirements should be tested.</p>

<p id="_8398c6a5-f956-e28c-bc35-4003e62b599c">This requirement stops
conformance classes from containing optional requirements and tests, and, at least
as far as the standard is concerned, makes all certificates of conformance mean
that exactly the same tests have been conducted. Standards documents may use
recommendations for such options, but the conformance test classes do not test
recommendations.</p>

<p id="_2445644c-9c0e-8ff3-7002-aacc0a5143a9">This means that the class’s tests
depend on some parameter that must be defined before the tests can be executed. This can
be thought of as an “if-then-else” decision tree.</p>

<p id="_4787a661-4d57-c9ac-8275-de8b13381268">For example, if a conformance class needs to apply tests against a specific data format, such as GML or
KML, then XYZ(GML) is XYZ using GML, and XYZ(KML) is XYZ using KML.
Because the parameters choose which requirements will be tested, two conformance
classes with distinct parameters should be considered as distinct conformance
classes.</p>

<p id="_b597a17f-9259-902b-89c2-98bf7e274aa9">The most common parameters are the identities of indirect dependencies. For example,
if a service uses or produces feature data, the format of that data may be a
parameter, such as GML, KML or GeoJSON. When reading a certificate of conformance,
the values of such parameters are very important.</p>

schema-aware process first encounters a namespace URI it must always be associated
to a schema location (a file) that contains or includes all schema components having
the URI as their namespace. This is referred to as the “all-components schema

Retrieval operations allow features to be retrieved from the opaque underlying data store based upon constraints on spatial and non-spatial feature properties defined by the client.

It treats “vector” geometry and topology. It defines standard spatial operations for use in access, query, management, processing and data exchange of geographic information for spatial (geometric and topological) objects. Because of the nature of geographic information, these geometric coordinate spaces will normally have up to three spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension and any number of other spatially dependent parameters as needed by the applications. In general, the topological dimension of the spatial projections of the geometric objects will be at most three.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>90</stage>        <substage>20</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2019</from>        <owner>          <organization>

It describes the minimum data required to define coordinate reference systems. This document supports the definition of: —          spatial coordinate reference systems where coordinate values do not change with time. The system may: — —   be geodetic and apply on a national or regional basis, or — —   apply locally such as for a building or construction site, or — —   apply locally to an image or image sensor; — —   be referenced to a moving platform such as a car, a ship, an aircraft or a spacecraft. Such a coordinate reference system can be related to a second coordinate reference system which is referenced to the Earth through a transformation that includes a time element; —          spatial coordinate reference systems in which coordinate values of points on or near the surface of the earth change with time due to tectonic plate motion or other crustal deformation. Such dynamic systems include time evolution, however they remain spatial in nature; —          parametric coordinate reference systems which use a non-spatial parameter that varies monotonically with height or depth; —          temporal coordinate reference systems which use dateTime, temporal count or temporal measure quantities that vary monotonically with time; —          mixed spatial, parametric or temporal coordinate reference systems. The definition of a coordinate reference system does not change with time, although in some cases some of the defining parameters can include a rate of change of the parameter. The coordinate values within a dynamic and in a temporal coordinate reference system can change with time. This document also describes the conceptual schema for defining the information required to describe operations that change coordinate values. In addition to the minimum data required for the definition of the coordinate reference system or coordinate operation, the conceptual schema allows additional descriptive information — coordinate reference system metadata — to be provided. This document is applicable to producers and users of geographic information. Although it is applicable to digital geographic data, the principles described in this document can be extended to many other forms of spatial data such as maps, charts and text documents.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>90</stage>        <substage>92</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2019</from>        <owner>          <organization>

ISO 19136:2007 defines the XML Schema syntax, mechanisms and conventions that: — provide an open, vendor-neutral framework for the description of geospatial application schemas for the transport and storage of geographic information in XML; — allow profiles that support proper subsets of GML framework descriptive capabilities; — support the description of geospatial application schemas for specialized domains and information communities; — enable the creation and maintenance of linked geographic application schemas and datasets; — support the storage and transport of application schemas and data sets; — increase the ability of organizations to share geographic application schemas and the information they describe.

Such movement has the following characteristics. — The feature moves within any domain composed of spatial objects as specified in ISO 19107. — The feature may move along a planned route, but it may deviate from the planned route. — Motion may be influenced by physical forces, such as orbital, gravitational, or inertial forces. — Motion of a feature may influence or be influenced by other features, for example:  The moving feature might follow a predefined route (e.g. road), perhaps part of a network, and might change routes at known points (e.g. bus stops, waypoints). Two or more moving features may be “pulled” together or pushed apart (e.g. an airplane will be refuelled during flight, a predator detects and tracks a prey, refugee groups join forces). Two or more moving features may be constrained to maintain a given spatial relationship for some period (e.g. tractor and trailer, convoy).   ISO 19141:2008 does not address other types of change to the feature. Examples of changes that are not adressed include the following: — The deformation of features. — The succession of either features or their associations. — The change of non-spatial attributes of features. — The feature’s geometric representation cannot be embedded in a geometric complex that contains the geometric representations of other features, since this would require the other features’ representations to be updated as the feature moves. Because ISO 19141:2008 is concerned with the geometric description of feature movement, it does not specify a mechanism for describing feature motion in terms of geographic identifiers. This is done, in part, in ISO 19133.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>90</stage>        <substage>93</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2008</from>        <owner>          <organization>

These components are modular and intended to be used together or individually by other International Standards which reference ISO 19143:2010.  ISO 19143:2010 defines an abstract component, named AbstractQueryExpression, from which other specifications can subclass concrete query elements to implement query operations.  It also defines an additional abstract query component, named AbstractAdhocQueryExpresison, which is derived from AbstractQueryExpression and from which other specifications can subclass concrete query elements which follow the following query pattern:  — An abstract query element from which service specifications can subclass a concrete query element that implements a query operation that allows a client to specify a list of resource types, an optional projection clause, an optional selection clause, and an optional sorting clause to query a subset of resources that satisfy the selection clause. This pattern is referred to as an ad hoc query pattern since the server in not aware of the query until it is submitted for processing. This is in contrast to a stored query expression, which is stored and can be invoked by name or identifier.  ISO 19143:2010 also describes an XML and KVP encoding of a system-neutral representation of a select clause. The XML representation is easily validated, parsed and transformed into a server-specific language required to retrieve or modify object instances stored in some persistent object store.  ISO 19143:2010 defines the XML encoding for the following predicates. — A standard set of logical predicates: and, or and not. — A standard set of comparison predicates: equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, like, is null and between. — A standard set of spatial predicates: equal, disjoint, touches, within, overlaps, crosses, intersects, contains, within a specified distance, beyond a specified distance and BBOX. — A standard set of temporal predicates: after, before, begins, begun by, contains, during, ends, equals, meets, met by, overlaps and overlapped by. — A predicate to test whether the identifier of an object matches the specified value. ISO 19143:2010 defines the XML encoding of metadata that allows a service to declare which conformance classes, predicates, operators, operands and functions it supports. This metadata is referred to as Filter Capabilities.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>90</stage>        <substage>93</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2010</from>        <owner>          <organization>

This language, GeoREL, is an extension of the rights expression language in ISO/IEC 21000-5 and is to be used to compose digital licenses. Each digital license will unambiguously express those particular rights that the owners (or their agent) of a digital geographic resource extend to the holders of that license. The digital rights management system in which these licenses are used can then offer ex ante (before the fact) protection for all such resources. NOTE          The proper use of a GeoREL includes the preservation of rights access by formula expressed in usage licenses. Thus, data in the public or private domain, when protected, remain in their respective domains if the usage rights granted so state.  These “rights” are not always covered by copyright law, and are often the result of contracts between individuals that specify the proper and allowed uses of resources, as opposed to the threat of copyright litigations which is an ex post facto (after the fact) remediation measure, not an ex ante protection measure. ISO 19149:2011 is not a reflection of, or extension of, copyright law. Mechanisms for the enforcement and preservation of those contract rights are specified in ISO/IEC 21000, and it is not the intention of ISO 19149:2011 to replace nor redefine those mechanisms, but to use them as previously standardized.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>95</stage>        <substage>99</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2011</from>        <owner>          <organization>

As such, it is connected to the general DRM market in that geospatial resources shall be treated as nearly as possible like other resources, such as music, text, or services. It is not the intention to reinvent a market nor the technology that already exists and is thriving, but to make sure that a larger market has access to geospatial resources through a mechanism that it understands and that is similar to and consistent with the ones already in use. ISO 19153:2014 does not replace any previous standards, but it is dependent upon them. Each resource and service standard that exists or will exist becomes a resource description in ISO 19153:2014, and hopefully will be subject to the same protection that is afforded to other resources. This International Standard defines: —        A conceptual model for digital rights management of geospatial resources, providing a framework and reference for more detailed specification in this area. —        A metadata model for the expression of rights that associate users to the acts that they can perform against a particular geospatial resource, and associated information used in the enforcement and granting of those rights, such as owner metadata, available rights, and issuer of those rights. —        Requirements that are placed on rights management systems for the enforcement of those rights. A rights management system shall be necessary and sufficient: it shall implement only those restrictions necessary to enforce the rights defined therein, and it shall be sufficient to enforce those rights. —        How this is to work conceptually in the larger DRM context to ensure the ubiquity of geospatial resources in the general services market. A resource in this context is a data file, or service for geographic information or process. This abstract descriptive standard builds on and complements the existing standards, and defines at an abstract level a rights model to enable the digital rights management of standards-based geospatial resources. Future GeoDRM standards will be written to implement the concepts defined in ISO 19153:2014.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>95</stage>        <substage>99</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2014</from>        <owner>          <organization>

These provide models for the exchange of information describing observation acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical communities. Observations commonly involve sampling of an ultimate feature-of-interest. This document defines a common set of sample types according to their spatial, material (for ex situ observations) or statistical nature. The schema includes relationships between sample features (sub-sampling, derived samples). This document concerns only externally visible interfaces and places no restriction on the underlying implementations other than what is needed to satisfy the interface specifications in the actual situation.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>60</stage>        <substage>60</substage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2023</from>        <owner>          <organization>
